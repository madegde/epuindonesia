PP No. 36 further improves the formula by adding three more indicators: local purchasing power, labor absorption rate and median wage.\par \par \uc2 It is indeed inevitable that Indonesia's large population-- spread throughout the world's largest archipelago-- would resultin wide differences between provinces in terms of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions, potential,and the needs of workers.And this, too, will cause differences in theprovincial minimum wages--but not as striking as intended by Anies' \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 PP No. 36 was for the first time applied to determine the minimum wage for provinces for 2022, which resulted in an average rise of only 1.09 percent.\par \par \uc2 That increase seemed quite low compared to the average wage rise of 8 percent over the past five years to 2019, when gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged just 5 percent. The \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  did contract by 2.1 percent in 2020, but GDP is estimated to expand by 3.7 percent this year and by 5.2 to 5.6 percent next year, while inflation is estimated at 1.6 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2022.\par \par \uc2 But given what appears to be an anomaly,it is incumbent on the National Wage Council, which represents the government, employers,trade unions and academics, to explain to the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  in layman terms how each of the five indicators was weighted in the wage calculation.\par \par \uc2 Orwe will continue tobe mired in controversy for months to come.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020211228ehct0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

This can be seen by increased trading activities, IPOs and numbers of investors," IDX president director \uc2 Inarno Djajadi\uc2  told reporters on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 This year, the total funds raised through IPOs reached an all-time high of Rp 62.61 trillion (US$4.39 billion), compared to the usual of between Rp 10 trillion and Rp 20 trillion annually, aided by the jumbo IPO of e-commerce platform Bukalapak in July.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the number of portfolio investors increased 92.7 percent annually to 7.47 million this year, the highest growth rate since 2016, according to Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI) data.\par \par \uc2 The number of stock investors alone grew by 103 percent annually to 3.44 million in the same period, and retail investors dominated stock market trading for the first time ever, accounting for an average of 56.2 percent of daily trading volumes, compared to 48.4 percent last year.\par \par \uc2 The IDX Composite slid 0.29 percent to 6,581 on Thursday, but managed to close above 6,700 for the first time in the bourse's history in November.\par \par \uc2 Anugerah Mega Investama director Hans Kwee said low \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  during the pandemic had driven investors to look for better returns in stock markets and that continued mobility restrictions had led to a buildup of idle funds, a portion of which had gone into stocks.\par \par \uc2 He added that the rise of investment apps had helped accelerate the growth of portfolio investors, who have attracted the attention of companies looking for fresh funds at a time when banks were still cautious amid pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 KSEI president director Uriep Budhi Prasetyo noted on Thursday that the rise of fintech start-ups was a main driver behind the high growth of individual investors, as around 73.99 percent of these investors had opened investment accounts through a fintech brokerage.\par \par \uc2 Fintech brokerages also dominated mutual fund transactions with a 125 percent annual increase to 18.23 million transactions this year.\par \par \uc2 "Almost 74 percent of investors had an account on a fintech brokerage. Fintech has had a significant role in helping investor growth," he said.\par \par \uc2 IDX development director \uc2 Hasan Fawzi\uc2  noted that young investors, particularly millennials and younger, showed a greater tendency to invest in stocks outside LQ45 Futures - the IDX's most liquid index consisting of companies with high market caps and good fundamentals - than older investors.\par \par \uc2 "Now, transactions outside LQ45 index stocks are more dominant and are dominating daily transactions," Hasan said.\par \par \uc2 He added that young investors showed greater appetite for companies in the technology sector, such as digital banks and unicorns, as well as for companies with environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, the IDX listed 54 new companies, the highest number of any ASEAN country, bringing the bourse's total to 766 companies as of December. The IDX's Inarno said the bourse aimed to welcome even more companies in 2022.\par \par \uc2 The biggest IPO was that of Bukalapak, which raised Rp 21.9 trillion, worth around 25 percent of its enlarged capital, taking the title of biggest IDX listing from coal miner \uc2 PT Adaro Energy\uc2 , which raised $1.3 billion in 2008. News of Bukalapak's local listing triggered a spike in the IDX technology sector subindex (IDXTECHNO). The company is now trading at less than half its IPO price.\par \par \uc2 IDX assessment director I Gede Nyoman Yetna said investors showed a preference this year for IPOs from companies in the technology, infrastructure, basic materials, financial and consumer good sectors, a trend expected to carry over into next year.\par \par \uc2 "We hope all sectors will move, but this preference is apparent," Nyoman said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020211230ehcv0000b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Indonesia makes big promises on green  \highlight22\uc2 economy \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 Divya Karyza , The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 1,382 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 December 2021\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2021 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia announced an array of landmark green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  commitments this year, from putting a moratorium on new coal plants to establishing carbon trading regulations, in going along with the momentum of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) that started in late October.\par \par \uc2 The country submitted this year its long-term strategy for low carbon climate resilience (LTS-LCCR) to the \uc2 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\uc2  (\uc2 UNFCCC\uc2 ), in which Indonesia pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 "or sooner", a pledge that underpins the other green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  commitments.\par \par \uc2 Experts say the these commitments mark an important start in attaining net zero, but they also say these have a way to go before translating to changes on the ground, citing a lack of supporting regulations.\par \par \uc2 "This year shows improving political commitment, but it has not yet translated into implementation and improvement of key energy \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  documents that guide sector planning and development," the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) said in a report published in December.\par \par \uc2 IESR went on to say that, while the power sector transition to renewables improved this year, aspects including improving political will and renewables investment climate needed serious attention.\par \par \uc2 Coal phase-out\par \par \uc2 As part of its energy transition plan, the government has decided to stop building coal-fired power plants from 2025 onwards, apart from those already included in the 2021-2030 long-term electricity procurement plan (RUPTL).\par \par \uc2 However, there are still 13.8 gigawatts of coal plants to come online in the next 10 years, the RUPTL shows.\par \par \uc2 In this situation, coal plants would still be the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter in the energy sector in 2030 at 82 million tons per year, said senior climate and energy researcher with Greenpeace Indonesia, Adila Isfandiari, on Nov. 19.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Asian Development Bank\uc2  (ADB) and the government also launched this year a new financing scheme, called the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM), to speed up the retirement of high-emission coal plants in the country.\par \par \uc2 Among the 9.2 GW of coal plants identified for the ETM scheme, three coal plants in Java and Sumatra, with a total capacity of 1.77 GW, were selected for early retirement in 2022-2023, according to ADB.\par \par \uc2 "Whether [ETM] will help Indonesia reach its net-zero emission target by 2050 heavily depends on its implementation," Adila said, also on Nov. 19.\par \par \uc2 During COP26, Indonesia also joined India, the Philippines and South Africa -- which collectively account for 15 percent of coal-related emissions globally -- as the first beneficiaries of the Climate Investment Funds' (CIF) Accelerating Coal Transition (ACT) program to finance phasing out coal plants.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia then signed up to the COP26 Coal to Clean Power Transition statement, which included a pledge to consider bringing the coal phase-out forward to the 2040s, subject to international assistance, even though Indonesia excluded a clause to stop building new coal plants effective immediately. The energy ministry had estimated Indonesia could naturally retire coal by 2058.\par \par \uc2 Regarding the coal plant moratorium, Singgih Widagdo, chairman of the Indonesian Mining and Energy Forum (IMEF), said that the government needed to create a comprehensive 5-year road map for the coal mining sector, including mining contractors and mining services, to give certainty to their investment plans.\par \par \uc2 "[The road to the] coal moratorium must consider asset revaluation and write-offs. This, of course, requires funding from other countries to support the energy transition in Indonesia," he said on Dec. 23, adding that the road map would help coal mining players avoid over-investment and prevent environmental impacts caused by abruptly abandoned mining sites.\par \par \uc2 Coal plant growth reached its lowest level in the last five years in 2021 at around 308 megawatts in the January-September period, yet coal still dominates power generation capacities by accounting for approximately 66 percent of total capacity, according to energy ministry data.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, renewables only contributed 13.53 percent of power generation capacity in the same period, with an additional renewables capacity of 386 MW coming online as of September. An additional 9 MW of renewables is expected to come online by the end of 2021, giving a total renewables capacity of 395 MW.\par \par \uc2 New green finance rules\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  passed on Oct. 7 the Harmonized \b \highlight22\uc2 Tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  Law, which lays the foundation for a domestic carbon market as Indonesia follows a global trend.\par \par \uc2 The law introduces a minimum carbon \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  rate of Rp 30,000 (US$2.10) per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), which will be implemented under a cap-and-trade scheme. The scheme will be enforced solely on coal plants beginning in April 2022 and applied to other sectors in a full-scale carbon trading scheme by 2025.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi then passed in November a derivative presidential \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  that put a price on carbon emissions. The \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  forms the basis of Indonesia's carbon-pricing scheme as one of several measures to deliver on the country's nationally determined contribution (NDC) and net-zero goal.\par \par \uc2 The government instructed the \uc2 Indonesia Stock Exchange\uc2  (IDX) to handle the implementation of a domestic carbon trading system.\par \par \uc2 IESR executive director Fabby Tumiwa previously said that it might take three years for Indonesia to complete its carbon market design, which had to include well-defined targets, details on each sectors' contribution and mechanisms to ensure compliance.\par \par \uc2 "If we fail or are not serious, we will lose our chance to [transition] to low-carbon industries and our long-term competitiveness will be eroded," he said.\par \par \uc2 The IDX also launched in December two new indexes that are based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores, catering to growing investor interest in the performance of companies beyond their corporate financials.\par \par \uc2 Renewables shortfall\par \par \uc2 NRE power generation capacity has increased by an average 1,469 MW annually over the last five years, marking an average annual growth rate of 4 percent.\par \par \uc2 This figure is less than half of the 3,000 MW annual capacity increase needed for NRE to make up 23 percent of the national energy mix target by 2025 as required by prevailing regulations, according to IESR.\par \par \uc2 IESR notes in its Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook 2022 report that current energy policies have yet to provide a sense of security for NRE investors.\par \par \uc2 "The renewable energy law and Presidential \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on feed-in-\b \highlight22\uc2 tariff\b0 \highlight\uc2  [FiT] and \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on energy conservation suffer more delays this year and are expected to be enacted next year," IESR said in a report, adding that the delays had caused extended \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  for investors.\par \par \uc2 Elrika Hamdi, an energy economist with the \uc2 Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis\uc2  (IEEFA), suggested state-owned electricity company PLN focus on improving its procurement process and making bankable power purchase agreements (PPA) to boost NRE power plant projects in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 "The first thing the government needs to do is create predictability for NRE developers," she said on Dec 22.\par \par \uc2 Glaring absence of energy efficiency\par \par \uc2 In 2021, Indonesia's commitment to achieve its net-zero target by 2060 was still missing a significant part of the energy transition: energy efficiency.\par \par \uc2 The government in 2021 took several measures to improve energy efficiency, including working with the \uc2 International Energy Agency\uc2  (IEA) to provide training on energy efficiency indicators in the industrial sector and issuing Energy and Mineral Resources Ministerial \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 14/2021 to regulate the Minimum Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) and energy labeling for electronic appliances.\par \par \uc2 However, greater efforts were needed to encourage investment in energy conservation projects for industries, according to IEEFA's Elrika, as that sector needed to reduce its final energy consumption by 17 percent from a business-as-usual scenario as per prevailing regulations.\par \par \uc2 From 2015 to 2019, investment in the energy-efficiency sector in Indonesia amounted to Rp 396.16 billion, according to the same data, which is only a fraction of investment possibilities totaling $154.35 million identified by the ministry.\par \par \uc2 According to the same data, energy audits and energy conservation for the industry are the biggest business opportunities, accounting for $75.65 million and $26 million, respectively, of the total investment potential.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the IESR report found that Indonesia's final energy consumption from the industrial, transportation, household and commercial sectors had steadily increased from 2014 to 2020.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020211230ehcv0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Relief as 2021 wraps up\b0\par\par\uc2 Yerica Lai and Dio Suhenda, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 693 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 December 2021\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2021 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Amid preparations to welcome in the new year, the country is united in the hope that the dark days of 2021, particularly the deadly Delta wave of the coronavirus, will not repeat themselves, as the highly mutated Omicron variant makes its way into the country.\par \par \uc2 The devastating Delta wave, exacerbated by a lack of mobility restrictions during this year's Idul Fitri holidays, caused a case surge that brought the country's health system to the brink of collapse.\par \par \uc2 It also caused the nation to pass the grim milestone of 100,000 COVID-19 deaths in August.\par \par \uc2 As the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus threatens another case surge, President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo has called for optimism and unity going into the new year.\par \par \uc2 "The way forward is not always easy. Sometimes, trials and tribulations must be experienced by our society," said Jokowi in a prerecorded speech to commemorate Christmas and New Year on Tuesday. "But with a strong spirit and unity, we will succeed in facing all challenges."\par \par \uc2 Indonesia briefly became the global epicenter of the pandemic in July, with hospitals, particularly on Java, scrambling to treat COVID-19 patients amid shortages of oxygen and other medical supplies.\par \par \uc2 Toll on health workers\par \par \uc2 Yetti said she remembered her daughter Liza, a 34-year-old nurse who treated COVID-19 patients in a makeshift emergency hospital and isolation facility in Kemayoran, Central Jakarta, as a strong-willed and dedicated daughter.\par \par \uc2 "She said she wanted to volunteer and save lives. When she wanted to do something, nothing could stop her," said Yetti, who worked as a midwife and had repeatedly asked her daughter to do something less risky.\par \par \uc2 On June 3, Liza contracted the virus after months treating COVID-19 patients at the athlete village-turned-hospital. She passed away 20 days later and is survived by her two children.\par \par \uc2 "I learned through her that God has a plan for everything," Yetti said.\par \par \uc2 As of Thursday, more than 2,000 health workers had died as a result of the pandemic, according to data compiled by independent data initiative LaporCOVID-19.\par \par \uc2 Longing for normalcy\par \par \uc2 The surge in COVID-19 cases also led to the establishment of emergency \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity restrictions (PPKM Darurat), the country's strictest curbs to date, which took a heavy toll on the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and stalled the much-anticipated \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 For 37-year-old Deny Akbar, who works as a freelance event organizer, the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  impact from the second wave was devastating, as almost all events were canceled. The situation forced him to sell his assets to feed his wife and two kids.\par \par \uc2 Deny, who lives in Pamulang, South Tangerang, said the situation had improved since and that he had been able to organize virtual events to bring in income.\par \par \uc2 "I hope we do not repeat the situation [of 2021]. Hopefully, everything will return to normal, because we are weary," said Deny.\par \par \uc2 With tourism among the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, Nyoman Triastama, who works as a freelance tour guide in Bali, said he was concerned that the Omicron variant would bring another set of stringent curbs to the tourism-dependent island.\par \par \uc2 The government claimed in October to have reopened Bali to international tourists from selected countries, but the move has failed to attract many visitors because of long quarantine periods, a lack of international flights and enduring virus fears.\par \par \uc2 Nyoman called on domestic tourists to visit Bali whenever they got the chance.\par \par \uc2 "With the current situation, I hope that other Indonesians, particularly those who have more disposable income, come to Bali, rather than traveling abroad," said Nyoman.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Caron Toshiko Monika, the 31-year-old owner of a Jakarta-based independent photobook publisher and gallery, said she had come to accept the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  that the pandemic had brought and was feeling more optimistic this year.\par \par \uc2 "I feel more confident than I did last year because the vaccine itself, as a form of self-defense against the virus, has reduced the fear," she said, adding that she hoped COVID-19 cases would not spike again.

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 Investments During the Pandemics\par \par \uc2 DURING this Covid-19 pandemic, investment is becoming a trend, especially among the millennials that are starting to realize the importance of investing. In addition, the pandemic has made the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  suddenly to go digital. Based on the data, there is an increase in the number of investors by 2.3 million, to become 6.1 million now. The value of the digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  soared to US$70 billion.\par \par \uc2 Even though investment is becoming a trend, novice investors need to be careful or more scrupulous in choosing an application platform that is not only easy, but also safe. In this case, the role of the ministry of communication and informatics must be maximized to be the institution that first analyzes applications that have the potential to become an arena for gambling, fraud, and fraudulent investments. Then the financial services authority plays a role in ensuring that financial services companies are safe to invest while continuing to educate the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Tsalsabilla Anindya Kusuma Dewi\par \par \uc2 Malang, East Java\par \par \uc2 Criminal Codes and Tourism\par \par \uc2 THE Criminal Code Bill is currently in the process of being finalized. A number of its articles have the potential to interfere with private spaces which can affect tourism. Whereas one important aspect of the tourism sector is the protection of privacy.\par \par \uc2 There are several articles that invade \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  privacy, such as article 417 which states, \u8220\'20\'1CAnyone who has sexual intercourse with someone other than his husband or wife is punished for adultery with a maximum imprisonment of 1 year and a category II fine.\u8221\'20\'1D Then article 419 states, \u8220\'20\'1CEveryone who lives together as spouses without legal marital relationship shall be punished with imprisonment for a maximum of 6 months or a fine of category II.\u8221\'20\'1D Indeed, complaints about extramarital status must be made by parents, children, and spouses. However, for living together, complaints can also be made by the village head or officials at the same level.\par \par \uc2 Article 420 would criminalize obscene acts with elements of a \u8220\'20\'1Csame sex\u8221\'20\'1D crime. This article seems to be targeting groups of people with different sexual orientations.\par \par \uc2 These articles would intervene in the private sphere even though there are legal provisions that preside in society, namely laws based on regional regulations. Often the rules in society and regions discriminate against certain groups, such as women and sexual minority groups.\par \par \uc2 The emergence of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the Criminal Codes Bill will make the tourism sector suffer even more after being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Rifqi Adiyatma Nur Shafa\par \par \uc2 Malang Muhammadiyah University, East Java\par \par \uc2 Practicing Religion Moderately\par \par \uc2 PRACTICING religion should be done moderately. We must not blame or even vilify the beliefs of others who are different from ours. We must respect and appreciate what they believe, as well as the religion they profess.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, there has been a lot of intolerant behavior in Indonesia, such as the rejection of the construction of houses of worship and the obligation of non-Muslims to wear headscarves at school.\par \par \uc2 Abdurrahman Wahid alias Gus Dur once said, \u8220\'20\'1CIt does not matter what religion or ethnicity you are, if you can do something good for everyone, people will never ask what your religion is.\u8221\'20\'1D We must help each other when adherents of one of the religions are carrying out their worship. We should not be afraid of our faith collapsing when helping people from other religions who are worshiping. We help them from the humanity side, as social beings who need each other\u8217\'20\'19s help.\par \par \uc2 The loss of tolerance in Indonesia can lead to discord. This can lead to the emergence of social conflicts in society and the loss of a sense of brotherhood. That is the importance of practicing religion moderately. Qur\u8217\'20\'19an interpretation expert, Quraish Shihab, stated that wasathiyah or moderation is one of the characteristics of religion and religious people need to be moderate.\par \par \uc2 Muhamad Ibnu Agil\par \par \uc2 West Jakarta\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/01/02/791387/791387_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220103ei120000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 This year, let's give COVID-19 vaccines another shot\b0\par\par\uc2 1,277 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Harya S. Dillon, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 It's 2022 and we are well into our third year of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon reflection, a lot has changed since the novel coronavirus was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. According to \uc2 World Health Organization\uc2  data, up to 5.4 million lives have been lost globally to COVID-19, including at least 144,000 Indonesians. In July 2021, Indonesia endured one of the most testing periods in its living memory when our health systemnearly succumbed to the Delta variant outbreak.\par \par \uc2 Waking up to a 2022 sunrise, we cannothelp but ask ourselves what we have learned from the harrowing episode that was 2021. And most importantly, how can we write--fingers-crossed -- the closing chapter we hope 2022 to be. Here are my takes.\par \par \uc2 First and foremost, we need to boost our vaccination programs. In early April 2021, when demand greatly outnumbered supply, we had volunteers rolling up their sleeves helping the government distribute and administer shots. Volunteer-run vaccination centers were instrumental in getting vaccines to eligible groups and shortened long lines. Along with an improved supply chain and the PeduliLindungi app mandate for travelers and mall patrons, this has helped the government deliver up to 2 million vaccine dosesdaily, to much of President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo's delight.\par \par \uc2 However, some 270 million doses later, with 53 percent of the targeted population fully vaccinated, some makeshift vaccination centers have shut down and long lines are no longer observed. This indicates that the government may need a new approach to "boost" vaccine awareness as supply has exceeded demand.\par \par \uc2 As a rule, the government should offer incentives before making vaccines mandatory. For example, through its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the government can offer free data plans in urban areas with low vaccination rates and perhaps livestock to their rural counterparts. Measures such as requiring government and SOE contractors alike to furnish vaccine certificates for all its employees should be considered in the next procurement cycle as well.\par \par \uc2 Second, we need boosters. While I fully agree with epidemiologists who have voiced their concerns about vaccine equity, we should never let the vaccine-hesitant, worse still, the anti-vaxxers dictate our policies. When vaccine doses are at a surplus because of artificially low demand, it is not prudent to let those valuable shots expire. Why not use those near-expiration vials to boost those who have shown interest in getting protected?\par \par \uc2 We have lost many to the virus. But it appears we have lost many more to the seemingly incurable pandemic of disinformation. We must rendezvous with reality: Too many of our brethren are ideological anti-vaxxers. We might never get them to vaccinate no matter the incentives, no matter the constitutionally allowable mandates. All the while, our children are being deprived of their fundamental right to a functional and safe in-class education for the second year running.\par \par \uc2 The majority who has diligently conformed to government mandates, with some having volunteered to help with government vaccination programs, should not be punished by the ideologically defiant minorities. As such, we have no choice but to figure out a way to attain herd immunity without their vaccine participation. This is not to "leave them behind";the fact is, they have left us fighting this pandemic by ourselves.\par \par \uc2 We all are hoping that our children can safely return to their classrooms so that future Indonesians can be more competitive in the global job markets, earning dignified living wages. After some 20 months, losing a generation to COVID-19-induced remote learning may prove to be the greatest untold tragedy of the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Vaccine equity should be interpreted in term of access and availability; those who want the shot should be able to get one free of charge. Clearly, vaccination programs have enjoyed bipartisan political support. The anti-vaxxers should never have a say in our future as a nation.\par \par \uc2 The majority who has diligently conformed to government mandates, with some having volunteered to help with government vaccination programs, should not be punished by the ideologically defiant minorities.\par \par \uc2 Third, we need to first prioritize boosters for workers in the education and transportation sectors now that we have mostly covered our healthcare front-liners. Like education, \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  transportation is an essential service, yet it has taken a back seat when it comes to government priorities.\par \par \uc2 Ridership in the TransJakarta bus system, for example, is only half of its pre-pandemic levels or around 500,000 daily passengers. Certainly, this is a marked improvement compared to mid-2020 when ridership plunged to a 10 percent level nadir point. Airline and railways passengers have also increased by more than 60 percent compared to the lowest point but are still too far below its pre-pandemic levels.\par \par \uc2 This is attributable to the government's unwillingness to promote collective transportation even when it is relatively safe compared to office buildings and places of worship-- from which infection clusters have been repeatedly identified. One is welcome to their own opinion about our infection tracking and tracing systems. But the same allegedly faulty system did not pick up clusters within frontline transportation workers who, inarguably, are in close contact with passengers.\par \par \uc2 The government's unwillingness may indeed be attributed to a lack of confidence in its own vaccination success. Aside from it being a bad communication strategy, it runs in contrast with opening malls at full capacity, as well as allowing outdoor concerts in some jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 Talking about priorities, this all must change in 2022. In addition to booster shots, the government needs to regularly test and screen education and transportation sector workers for COVID-19 as an "early warning system" in detecting and mitigating the risk of infection clusters.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, we need those boosters free of charge. Whom are we trying to kid? President Jokowi truly deserves honest and sound advice from his Cabinet members,some of whom are captains of monopolistic industries. If anything, as holders of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  office, they should never fail to recognize where profiteering must endand \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  interest begins.\par \par \uc2 We need to heed the lessons from the doomed paid vaccination proposal of 2021. There is no good justification for charging those who help fight the pandemic by getting fully vaccinated, no matter how "perceivably affordable" the fees.\par \par \uc2 I for one abhor the narrative peddled by supporters and alleged-financial beneficiariesof the then-proposed paid-vaccination program of 2021. Not only have they incorrectly characterized freebies as traits of communism, but they also shamelessly continued to push social media campaigns even when Western states and even India never considered penalizing their citizens for joining the fight against the pandemic with vaccine charges. Let's not forget that vaccines, and by extension boosters, are \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  goods; they protectthose who take them and those around them.\par \par \uc2 President Jokowi swiftly trashed the proposal. Our booster \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  should echo that of President Jokowi's free-of-charge vaccine \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  of 2021. If anything, we need to reward those who have proven to be supportive of the government's pandemic initiative and not penalize them with "compliance fees" while the deviants are left unafflicted.\par \par \uc2 In closing, 2022 offers a mixed outlook. On one hand, we are seeing irrefutable signs of an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery; but on the other, the Omicron variant remains lurking in the shadows of scientific \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Any road, vaccination and its booster are still our best path out of this pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Let's give vaccines another shot in 2022.\par \par \uc2 ___________________\par \par \uc2 Secretary-general of the Indonesian Transportation Society, with a PhD from the \uc2 University of California, Irvine\uc2  and a Fulbright scholar (2019)\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220103ei1400008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: 2022 outlook: Aiming for resilient, sustainable recovery\b0\par\par\uc2 802 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Dian Ayu Yustina, Mandiri, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Signs of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery continued to emerge toward the end of 2021. COVID-19 was relatively well contained compared to July's peak when the Delta wave hit Indonesia. The recent gradual relaxation in social restrictions led to a steady rebound in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's consumer confidence index improved to 118.5 in November, the highest reading since January 2020. This is in line with the Mandiri \b \highlight22\uc2 Spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  Index, which climbed further to 127.8 by mid-December from 120.5 at the end of November, suggesting a convincing recovery in private consumption.\par \par \uc2 The government also recently announced that \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue in 2021 exceeded the initial target, reaching 103.9 percent, which rarely happens. This confirms the significant rebound in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity as companies responded to recovering demand.\par \par \uc2 The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which measures manufacturing activity, has been consistently above 50 since September 2021, which indicates expansion. \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery is also supported by a windfall from commodity exports as global commodity prices sharply increased due to the pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. Larger commodity income helped support export performance and also increase the government non-\b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue.\par \par \uc2 Recovery can accelerate further in 2022, as private consumption should rebound along with improving consumers' and investors' confidence, provided that COVID-19 cases remain under control. Recovering private consumption and domestic demand will be met with increasing production and investment activity.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is expected to rebound to its pre-pandemic growth level at 5 percent in 2022.\par \par \uc2 Yet, the recovery is not without risks. One of the key risks is the phenomenon of rising global inflation resulting from supply chain disruption and rising commodity prices. Higher inflation may lead to a faster global normalization \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2  recently accelerated its quantitative easing tapering, which may soon be followed by raising the benchmark \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  (Fed Funds Rate). Some other countries have already begun the cycle of raising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  to contain inflationary pressure.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia is not an exception, sooner or later, these global dynamics will affect the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, it is important for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to be in a stronger position to be able to withstand any potential volatility risk arising from these global \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  shifts. \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2 , monetary and financial system authorities need to maintain synergy, support growth and stability, while at the same time be flexible in facing the global dynamics.\par \par \uc2 The other key risk to \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery is the global development of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent increase in the new Omicron variant should be managed carefully as other countries start to see rapid increases in Omicron cases.\par \par \uc2 The government must consistently implement the vaccination plans, health protocols, testing and tracing especially for foreign travelers. Keeping COVID-19 at bay is a necessary condition for a resilient \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, a resilient \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery needs to be supported by a strong and resilient health sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the importance of pursuing reforms in the health sector.\par \par \uc2 The government has laid out reform plans, which cover improving the resiliency of health facilities, access to financing, the skills of medical staff and health technology reforms. Health services and facilities need to be strengthened as there is still \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  over the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 For example, with its large population, it is important for Indonesia to build mass production facilities for medicines, vaccines or medical devices, which will reduce reliance on imported products.\par \par \uc2 One of the positive outcomes of the pandemic is that it brought a renewed motivation to improve health, environment and other social aspects of life.\par \par \uc2 The world has become increasingly aware of the importance of addressing climate change and other broader sustainability agendas as we aim for a more sustainable and quality-based \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 The sustainability agenda has become increasingly popular. A successful transition to a sustainable future requires international collaboration and transformations across multiple sectors. These issues will be some of the key highlights at the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  meeting that will be held in Indonesia this year.\par \par \uc2 The government has also recently started to focus on and create strategies toward achieving a more sustainable \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 For example, in the new \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  law, the government laid out foundations for carbon \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  and carbon trading mechanisms as one of the efforts to fulfill the commitment in the climate change agenda. A road map for the transition to renewable energy has also been set.\par \par \uc2 Going forward, both the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and private sectors need to be ready in preparing the foundation for the implementation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, energy transition and sustainable financing in order to push for a more sustainable and resilient \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 ________________\par \par \uc2 Economist at Bank Mandiri\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220104ei1500006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Indonesian  \highlight22\uc2 economy \highlight\uc2  enters 2022 with more resilience\b0\par\par\uc2 932 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Winarno Zain, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  shrunk by 2.2 percent in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first contraction since 1998. But this seemed shorter-lived and milder than the declines in Malaysia (5.6 percent), Thailand (6.1 percent), the Philippines (9.5 percent), Singapore (5.4 percent) and India (8 percent).\par \par \uc2 By 2021, the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was on its way to growth. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the nine months to September 2021 was 3.2 percent with growth for the whole year estimated at 3.6 to 3.7 percent. Government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  and gross fixed capital formation were the main drivers of growth, growing at 3.6 percent respectively. \b \highlight22\uc2 Spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  grew 1.5 percent, well below the 5 percent average in the years prior to pandemic. In the third quarter of 2021, out of the 3.5 percent GDP growth year-on-year, \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  contributed a meagre O.55 percent. Given the large share of \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the GDP, it will be difficult to achieve 5 percent growth as long as \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is depressed.\par \par \uc2 The realized \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  to November 2021 showed strong growth in government revenue of 19.4 percent to Rp 1.7 quadrillion (US$121.4 billion). Both \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue and nontax revenue grew strongly, with total receipts already exceeding the 2021 target by 28 percent due to higher commodity prices, especially oil, coal and palm oil. Coal prices were above $200 per ton, more than double the year before. Indonesian Crude Oil Prices (ICP) rose 55 percent to $85 per barrel, well above the $45 used as an assumption in the 2021 \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Total \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2  was Rp 2.3 quadrillion, about the same as last year. Higher \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  on infrastructure and procurement (mainly for healthcare needs) was offset by lower \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  for social aid and transfers to regions. The government believed that as the infection rate had declined sharply due to the higher level of vaccination and mobility restrictions, some social aid programs and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal stimulus\b0 \highlight\uc2  could be phased out.\par \par \uc2 But the disbursement by regional administrations of funds transferred from the central government remained low due to inadequate institutional capacity. This will hinder recovery in the regions because regional administrations depend on the central government for about 75 percent of their \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With strong revenue growth and flat \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  in November was 3.6 percent of GDP. It is likely the deficits will have been below the projected 5.8 percent of GDP as of the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 The recovery is also underpinned by a robust balance of payments. The current account in the third quarter of 2021 achieved asurplus of $4.5 billion, the highest in history, driven by a huge surplus in the merchandise balance of $15 billion, which was about twice the previous quarterly average.\par \par \uc2 Foreign exchange \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  totaled $146 billion at the end of November, including $6.3 billion from an additional quota of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) from the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 , coupled with a stable rupiah exchange rate, a declining share of financial assets held by nonresidents and muted inflation.\par \par \uc2 With a stronger \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  stance and a sizable current account surplus, there have been less government financing needs, as reflected in the debt financing in November 2021, which was Rp 670 trillion, about the same as in October. Indeed the monthly increase in debt financing has declined significantly since September 2021.\par \par \uc2 The banking sector remained strong after implementing difficult loan restructuring and has started to lend again after having negative growth up to May.Bank loans had grown 4.7 percent to Rp 5.71 quadrillion as of November. The growth was broad-based with working capital loans, investment loans and consumer loans all showing positive growth. Significant increases were recorded in mortgages (9 percent) and the mining sector (16 percent), while manufacturing was down 0.8 percent.\par \par \uc2 All of these positive indicators should make the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  more resilient and less vulnerable to market shocks and global market volatilities.\par \par \uc2 The global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2022 will be clouded by the aftermath of the COVID-19 storms. The rapid spread of the Delta and the Omicron variants in the United States and Europe have abruptly increased the dynamic of the pandemic and increased \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  on how it will impact the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On the domestic side, the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is facing \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  created by a Constitutional Court ruling that orders the government to revise the Job Creation Law, tensions in the industrial relations, pressure on climate change and increasing natural disasters.\par \par \uc2 The external and internal challenges will narrow monetary and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  space. \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  choices have become more difficult, with limited room to maneuver. \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  reform should be continued with support from two recently passed laws, the Harmonization \b \highlight22\uc2 Tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  Law and the Central-Regional \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  Relations Law.\par \par \uc2 Both laws could broaden \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  space by expanding the \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  base, raising \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  rates, strengthening regional finance by giving regional governments more authority in seeking funding sources and by improving competency of the staff who deal with budgeting through compulsory certification. This should minimize the obstacles to \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  disbursement in regions, which has been a chronic problem.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, monetary and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies have to strike a balance between strengthening macroeconomic resilience and supporting domestic growth, between tightening policies and loosening policies. And this should be done with due consideration to maintaining social protection \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , because there are still millions of Indonesians who have not come out of the poverty and hardship caused by COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 ___________________\par \par \uc2 An economist\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220104ei150000a\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Opinion\par \b \uc2 Striking a Balance: Risks to Growth Require "Light-Touch"  \highlight22\uc2 Policy \highlight\uc2  on Inflation\b0\par\par\uc2 1,268 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Globe\par \uc2 JGLOBE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Jakarta Globe Media. \par \par \uc2 The global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  shutdown we experienced in mid-2020 was unique in recent history for its ability to disrupt the flow of goods, services, and labor around the world. Since then, regionalized shutdowns in response to the resurgence of Covid-19 infections have been implemented periodically, often with very little warning.\par \par \uc2 Global supply chains have been badly affected by this \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , struggling to cope with the rapid recovery in demand for goods during 2021. This outsized demand is linked with healthy consumer and business balance sheets, helped by generous monetary and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies.\par \par \uc2 As a result, we have seen inflation rise sharply in both developed and emerging markets (EMs), causing concern for policymakers, companies, and investors. US core inflation (less energy and food) was running at 4.9 percent on an annualized basis in November, well above the \uc2 US Federal Reserve\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s (Fed\u8217\'20\'19s) stated long-term target.\par \par \uc2 Base effects have heightened this figure, but it has been elevated for the past eight months. There was a similar dynamic in the United Kingdom, Canada, the eurozone, and a range of EM countries.\par \par \uc2 Normally, figures like these would be enough to trigger concerted monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  action designed to cool the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Still, major central banks have, so far, taken a more considered approach, influenced by upheaval related to the Ccovid-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Taming inflation is the primary aim, but policymakers must frame their decisions in the context of waning growth and recovering labor markets, which could be further affected by the arrival of a new coronavirus variant.\par \par \uc2 Against this background, we believe global inflation will likely keep rising through year-end 2021, as demand remains high throughout the holiday period, and ongoing disruption to supply chains maintains pressure on input and output prices.\par \par \uc2 However, we expect inflation to peak before the halfway point of 2022 as \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth normalizes, demand eases off, and supply issues begin to dissipate. There is already evidence of this in lower backlogs of work and a gradual increase in finished goods inventories. The ongoing transition to a services-led \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  should also minimize the effect of cross-border supply-chain pressures.\par \par \uc2 Although we think inflation will shortly pass its peak, we do not expect it to return to normal levels until the end of 2022. Furthermore, inflation may stabilize at a higher level than we experienced in a pre-Covid-19 world where low inflation was taken for granted.\par \par \uc2 In our view, a range between 2.0\u8211\'20\'132.5 percent is more likely for several reasons, including wage growth and a more relaxed approach to inflation \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Wages are unlikely to rise uncontrollably, but we could see persistent upward pressure on wages across all sectors if labor participation rates continue to lag. Higher productivity levels may act to cool unit labor costs, but inflation will likely remain slightly more elevated than pre-pandemic levels for some time.\par \par \uc2 While the normalization of inflation next year is our base-case prediction, there is the possibility that certain risks materialize in concert and act to keep inflation high throughout 2022 and into 2023. In our view, this scenario is less likely, but it must be acknowledged given the effect this could have on financial markets.\par \par \uc2 Importantly, households have benefited from the pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 stimulus\b0 \highlight\uc2 , while restrictions on movement and travel have helped boost savings and \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  power. This could lead to persistent above-trend demand, which we believe is the major contributor to inflation. Unforeseen supply issues related to labor shortages, global production, fresh Covid-19 lockdowns, and energy shortages also can further exacerbate inflation.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, upcoming \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal stimulus\b0 \highlight\uc2  measures, such as US President Biden\u8217\'20\'19s US$1 trillion infrastructure package, may inadvertently add inflationary pressures while supporting \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth through major new construction projects.\par \par \uc2 Sustained recovery depends on a cautious approach from policymakers\par \par \uc2 We expect major central banks to take somewhat different approaches to monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  during 2022 while sticking to their carefully communicated plans for normalization. The \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2  and the \uc2 European \b \highlight22\uc2 Central Bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  have been sanguine in their approach. Still, the Fed, alongside the \uc2 Bank of Canada\uc2 , among others, has been more aggressive, initializing asset purchase tapering in advance of expected interest rate rises.\par \par \uc2 The Fed\u8217\'20\'19s asset purchase tapering program, begun in November, should be completed early in 2022, while the federal funds rate will also have risen from a very low level by the end of 2022 under current projections.\par \par \uc2 This kind of steady progress toward normalization should allow inflation to dissipate naturally, in our view, without the need for heavy-handed \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  intervention. Further moves to control inflation could precipitate a drawdown in equity markets, given current high valuations and growth that remains above trend but is slowing. The latest Fed projections show US real gross domestic product was already falling from a post-pandemic spike in 2021.\par \par \uc2 There is also a risk that reducing liquidity too quickly could slow growth to critical levels, weakening business confidence and corporate investment to such an extent that central banks are forced into a U-turn to reinflate economies and markets. Premature tightening might also undermine investor and consumer sentiment, making any retrospective loosening less effective.\par \par \uc2 In the United States, Fed Chairman \uc2 Jerome Powell\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s nomination to serve a second term creates welcome continuity for financial markets and should reduce fears around monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  stability. However, a reconfiguration of the Fed board might increase the chances of a more hawkish approach, dependent on the persistence of inflation and the influence of political factors such as \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Implications for multi-asset investment strategy\par \par \uc2 We continue to favor equities over bonds into 2022, as corporate earnings generally remain healthy, indicating that businesses can preserve profitability by passing rising input costs on to customers. This has been facilitated by high demand and demonstrates how certain inflation is not necessarily bad for equities.\par \par \uc2 If margins remain robust throughout 2022, equity markets could strengthen further as inflation normalizes. On the other hand, elevated valuations relative to historic levels, could come under pressure if high expectations for earnings performance are not met.\par \par \uc2 The ongoing threat from new variants of Covid-19 is one risk that could undoubtedly suppress earnings, particularly if governments choose to act cautiously. Lockdowns and travel restrictions of greater or lesser severity will all serve to disrupt business activity and affect consumer sentiment.\par \par \uc2 One interesting consideration is how inflation has impacted industry sectors differently, notably around wage growth, in an environment where increasing wages reduce earnings per share.\par \par \uc2 We have observed that rising wages are having a greater impact on companies with lower-paid workforces such as transportation and food retail, so we will be factoring this data into our equity investment decisions during 2022.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, the \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  yield curve is no longer steepening, which is a good indicator that the bond market is pricing at a peak for inflation. We believe this confirms our preference for equities. Given the risks attached to persistent inflation, we will maintain most of our fixed-income holdings in short-duration bonds with lower interest-rate sensitivity.\par \par \uc2 Such a stance signifies meaningful yield is difficult to achieve. However, that can be addressed, in our view, by investing in high-yield corporate bonds which offer significant carry-over US Treasuries with an attractive risk-return profile. Cash and short-term US Treasuries also play an important role in our investment strategy, offering protection against the elevated volatility expected as a product of monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization.\par \par \uc2 Ed Perks is the chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions.\par \par \uc2 Document JGLOBE0020220105ei1500002\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Costly Show of Force on Coal  \highlight22\uc2 Policy \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 700 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 January 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 THE year of the tiger 2022 begins with a big bang. Without warning, the Indonesian government bans coal export, across the board, for the whole month of January. The ban came about after coal miners failed to fulfill their domestic market obligation (DMO) to sell 25 percent of their product to the state electricity company, PLN. In 2021, all coal miners only supplied 63.5 million tons, less than half of their quota of 137.5 million tons.\par \par \uc2 Politically, this export ban does look \u8216\'20\'18sexy\u8217\'20\'19. Coal supply is crucial to provide electricity supply. The government also pegged the price of coal sold to the PLN at US$70 per ton.\par \par \uc2 Last year, coal companies were more attracted to export coal. It was simple business logic. The coal price in the export market went crazy. The price benchmark for Indonesian coal skyrocketed since January 2021, far beyond the US$70 per ton. In November 2021, Indonesian coal price reached US$215 per ton, nearly triple PLN\u8217\'20\'19s ceiling price. The temptation of getting such a huge extra profit was too strong. Many coal miners chose to neglect their DMO.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, coal miners already had the privilege to extract natural resources, which is constitutionally mandated to be utilized as much as possible for the welfare of the people. They returned that privilege by ignoring their obligation. It seems the government has a strong legitimation in imposing harsh punishments on those greedy corporations.\par \par \uc2 This time, however, the government\u8217\'20\'19s stern action actually is just an excessive show of force. And the government also just ignores the high cost from the unwanted side effects of this \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Good governance-wise, this export ban is really a bad example of how the government conducts their business by disobeying their own rule of the game.\par \par \uc2 According to the ministry of energy\u8217\'20\'19s own account, 85 out of 592 coal companies actually have met their DMO last year. And just like that, this blanket \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  punishes those good boys as well as the bad ones, indiscriminately.\par \par \uc2 The government will bear the biggest brunt of this indiscriminate \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  as well. This unnecessary burden can be avoided should it take more careful consideration by looking at some important numbers.\par \par \uc2 For one, this country enjoyed a huge jump in commodity export revenue, including coal, throughout 2021. It had been Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s lifeline in facing global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  tumult during the pandemic. The uptick in dollar earnings from exports has created surpluses in the balance of trade and current account last year. This time around, a one-month-long-coal-export-ban will make US$3 billion worth of potential export revenue simply disappear.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the government gave itself a pat on the back after meeting the \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue target. Without the jump in export commodity prices last year, it is impossible for that target to be surpassed. On the other hand, when commodity prices are estimated to start declining in 2022, the government is throwing away its chance to optimize \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  earnings when prices are still high.\par \par \uc2 That \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  also fails to consider global financial market sentiments that have rumbled with \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  throughout 2022. Lest we forget, there is a planned increase in Federal Reserve \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and a scheduled stop to The Fed\u8217\'20\'19s liquidity injections into the market. In this critical situation, policies that are taken without due consideration will only worsen market sentiments toward Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 If the DMO mechanism is proven to fail in securing coal supply for the PLN, the government should revise that \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Just to name an example, it can implement an export \b \highlight22\uc2 tariff\b0 \highlight\uc2  such as the one on palm oil, with some necessary adjustments. Perhaps, the government might implement another kind of special export royalty, or whatever the name is. There are myriad alternatives to DMO mechanism. Without a thorough revamp, the problems will only repeat every time coal export price comes into turmoil.\par \par \uc2 In conclusion, this show of force is clearly not the right way to solve the coal crisis. The government would be better off reverting the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  with egg on its face, rather than continuing this costly mistake.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/01/10/791985/791985_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220110ei190000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Is ASEAN branding still attractive for the region's youth?\b0\par\par\uc2 871 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Melinda Martinus , Singapore\par \par \uc2 Since ASEAN launched the 2025 ASEAN Community Vision, the regional bloc's branding has garnered excitement from its citizens, particularly the youth. The aspirations toward market integration, enhanced mobility andeven the "hype" discussion over a single currency in the region have laid the foundations for the youth to reorient themselves to the global standards for future \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  transformation.\par \par \uc2 As the community vision passes the midterms, assessing how the youth perceives the ASEAN branding is timelier than ever. The Youth, defined as individuals aged 15-35 years old, constitutes 34 percent of the ASEAN's 654 million population. Hence, their perceptions and enthusiasm over regional integration will shape the strategic \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  direction on future regional vision.\par \par \uc2 A recent surveylaunched by the ASEAN Secretariat onUnderstanding How Young People See ASEAN: Awareness, Valuesand Identityshows that university students across the region possess a strong awareness of ASEAN.\par \par \uc2 Over half of the students surveyed could demonstrate high familiarity with ASEAN, such as accurately naming and listing ASEAN member states, identifying the ASEAN flagand indicating ASEAN's founding year. Butfamiliarity with ASEAN does not necessarily equate to positive identification with ASEAN. For instance, less than half of the respondents said ASEAN countries were economically and politically similar, signifying the region's diversity instead of its shared identity.\par \par \uc2 Students in the survey also agreed that ASEAN is valuable. More than 90 percent of them believed that ASEAN membership benefited their country. They also thought that ASEAN diversity is an asset and ASEAN's future is essential.\par \par \uc2 Butwhen asked whether ASEAN benefited them personally, only three-quarters agreed;therefore, it is critical for ASEAN to facilitate a more inclusive community-building process so that the impacts of regional integration can be more wide-reaching.\par \par \uc2 The survey also emphasized the need formore visible and impactful cooperation. Students responding to the survey believed that \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  collaboration, tourismand development assistance are the three more essential domains for ASEAN future cooperation.\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, political and security cooperation were least favorable, although historically, ASEAN was established during the height of the Cold War as an institution to provide political stability and security in the region. The weak emphasis on political and security among the youth could be because the region has relatively enjoyed peace and stability over the past decades.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the study indicates that the ASEAN branding is still attractive among the youth. Generally, they demonstrated a high level of awareness and saw some regional integration values. But challenges to engage the youth to realize the lofty visions of ASEAN as a rule-based, people-orientedand people-centered region remain.\par \par \uc2 The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed young people to many \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Ina recent survey conducted by TODAY, a digital news platform, young people in Singapore saidthey have become more fearful because of the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 The pandemic has also significantly impactedthe mental health of young people in the country, with a significant number of respondents indicating they were consistently feeling "stressed out" and "anxious".\par \par \uc2 Similarly,a survey conducted by the \uc2 United Nations Population Fund\uc2  (\uc2 UNFPA\uc2 ) Indonesia's Youth Advisory Panelalso shows that young people in Indonesia felt anxious during the pandemic because of social distancing measures forcing schools and workplaces to close. Clearly, this situation is not favorable for full social and sustainable recovery, let alone for promoting a more cohesive regional integration.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, a series of incidents have pointed to the reality that young people in the region are frequently under assault and in danger of being harassed when expressing their freedom of speech. The military crackdown in Myanmar, for instance, hassent hundreds of youths to their death.\par \par \uc2 The young protesters in Myanmar are hardly alone. Since the youth-led protests to reform the monarchy in Thailand started in 2020, many have been charged withlese majeste. Young journalists across Indonesia and the Philippines have also experienced violent attacks and increased assaults that further deteriorate the countries' press freedom and democracy.\par \par \uc2 With these unfortunate events, the youth in the region could be consumed with domestic instability and at risk of looking more inward. This isnot conduciveto building regional optimism.\par \par \uc2 But despite those challenges, ASEAN can explore new areas to engage the youth in shaping the regional vision. For instance, the youth in the region careabout climate change and the destruction of nature.\par \par \uc2 They are also more likely than any other age group to actively engagein climate advocacy. ASEAN needs to increase capacity building and consolidate climate activism to create a more impactful\par \par \uc2 regional climate movement.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, young people in the region do embrace technology. Not only are they the users or consumers of the technology, but they also leverage it for \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and future employment by venturing into start-ups.\par \par \uc2 The regionminted 19 unicorns in 2021, and the number will only increase in the near future. ASEAN must provide an enabling environment for young, aspiringdigital entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 Increasing investments in education to keep up with innovations and to bear talent, enhancing trade and connectivity to help start-ups scale their business,and upskilling the workforce to stay competitive are some practical policies that need to be explored.\par \par \uc2 _________________\par \par \uc2 The lead researcher in sociocultural affairs at the ASEAN Studies Centre, \uc2 ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220109ei1a0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Trade surplus to narrow in 2022 as commodity prices normalize\b0\par\par\uc2 Dzulfiqar Fathur Rahman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 780 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia may not see in 2022 a trade surplus as large as in the past two years, as commodity prices are expected to retreat from unusually high levels.\par \par \uc2 The country's goods trade surplus in the January-to-November period of 2021 reached US$34.32 billion, 58.74 percent higher than the surplus seen in the entire 2020, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data show.\par \par \uc2 Surging commodity prices drove the unusually large trade surplus during the pandemic as exports relied on resources like coal, crude palm oil (CPO), nickel and copper.\par \par \uc2 However, commodity prices are expected to be lower this year than in 2021, according to economists at publicly listed state-owned lender \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We believe the trade surplus will tend to narrow in 2022," Bank Mandiri economist Faisal Rachman said on Tuesday. "But if the imbalance in the global recovery persists, there is still a chance that prices will remain high."\par \par \uc2 Commodity prices are expected to normalize this year as a result of rising supply, according to the economists, even as domestic consumption and raw material imports are projected to pick up as the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovers.\par \par \uc2 Newcastle coal futures, for example, have shown signs of normalizing after peaking at $269.50 per ton on Oct. 5, 2021, according to data published by \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  data provider Trading Economics.\par \par \uc2 There was a recent upward blip in the benchmark, however, as the coal price went up 10.48 percent to $174 per ton on Jan. 4 from a day earlier following Indonesia's decision to ban coal exports this month to safeguard supplies for power plants. That was the highest level since November.\par \par \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  economists said coal prices surged last year in part because China had stopped importing the commodity from Australia as ties between the two countries worsened. This led to shortages in China, sending both local and global prices up. Moreover, there was an unexpected increase in demand from the electricity sector.\par \par \uc2 For CPO, a labor shortage in the business in Malaysia, a key exporter of the commodity along with Indonesia, caused the price to surge. \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  economists said the lockdown in Malaysia in 2020 had caused CPO production to drop.\par \par \uc2 The CPO price was also on a downward trend after peaking at MYR 5,446 per ton ($1,299.36) in early November, according to data published by media outlet Business Insider. It stood at MYR 5,308 on Tuesday, up 0.93 percent from a day earlier.\par \par \uc2 Worldwide CPO production was forecast to grow by 4.9 percent in 2022, outpacing expected consumption growth at 2.7 percent, according to the \uc2 United States Department of Agriculture\uc2 , which pointed to incoming pressure on prices.\par \par \uc2 Kathrina Ell, senior Asia-Pacific economist at financial intelligence firm Moody's Analytics, said supply chain stress was forecast to continue easing in the first half of the year, citing improvements in indicators such as port traffic and supplier delivery times.\par \par \uc2 However, Ell said the Omicron coronavirus variant had increased \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and had raised the risk that supply chain issues would worsen.\par \par \uc2 "Indonesia's blistering trade surpluses are not expected to continue in 2022," Ell told the Post in an email on Thursday. "But export values and therefore receipts will remain relatively elevated, which will be an important support to the broader \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Shinta Kamdani, the deputy chairwoman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin), said a slowdown in exports was nearly certain, not only because of normalizing commodity prices but also sluggish growth in export productivity.\par \par \uc2 Shinta said exporters had plans to raise commodity shipments, but that would likely run up against a slowdown in demand for key commodities, including coal.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot determine yet how significant the slowdown in the export performance will be, because it hinges on the pandemic [impact] on fluctuating global commodity prices, logistics cost and demand," Shinta told the Post in a text message on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "On the domestic side, we also have to look at how the pandemic containment \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  affects export productivity, export supply chain efficiency and the ease of obtaining financing for export."\par \par \uc2 Center for Reform on Economics (CORE) Indonesia executive director Mohammad Faisal said this year's surplus was expected to build on the growth in manufacturing exports, especially steel to China.\par \par \uc2 Faisal said other manufactured goods, such as textiles and footwear to the United States, could also bolster this year's exports.\par \par \uc2 "Manufacturing [sector exports] remain relatively good, although not in an even way, because many countries are expected to be able to control the pandemic in 2022," Faisal said on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220110ei1b00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - \b \highlight22\uc2 Uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the epidemic hits Malaysia's tourism recovery without opening up foreign tourists, it is difficult to support\par \par \uc2 Tourism has always been one of the main sources of income for the Malaysia \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Prior to the pandemic outbreak, tourism pumped some RM86 billion into Malaysia in 2019. The industry has also created numerous job opportunities, adding 3.6 million jobs across the country.\par \par \uc2 However, the Coronavirus outbreak of 2020 has impacted industries across the world. The highly people-centric tourism industry was suddenly brought to a halt.\par \par \uc2 It has been two years and the Covid-19 pandemic has continued to rage on. Countries around the world have rolled out their vaccination drives to inoculate their population against the virus which has brought the number of confirmed cases down significantly. As the tourism industry almost saw signs of recovery on the horizon, a highly contagious Omicron variant of the virus was detected, setting the tourism industry even further back on their road to recovery.\par \par \uc2 Oriental Daily conducted a number of interviews with several Malaysian tourism company operators to get a better understanding of the current state of the industry.\par \par \uc2 Leong Wai Hong, acting chairperson of the Malaysian Inbound Tourism Association, said that the unstable and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  epidemic has made the tourism industry unable to see a way forward.\par \par \uc2 According to her the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus has had little impact on the tourism industry in general, however it has had a more noticeable effect on the recovering inbound tourism industry.\par \par \uc2 "In this period of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , those of us in the industry cannot see a way forward. We are unable to make plans for anything because the pandemic is changing so often.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For example, local inbound tourism operators had at first, planned to roll out several promotional activities in 2022 for tourism. However due to the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  brought about by the Omicron variant, many of these projects had to be readjusted or put on hold.\par \par \uc2 Speaking frankly, she said that although Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s current tourism industry is experiencing a good recovery, the climate is still far from conducive for a full recovery of the tourism sector.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEvery stage of recovery has been short-lived. Progress flattens out and then recovery begins again before being flattened. This unpredictable state is far from conducive to the overall recovery of the tourism sector.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She pointed out that in order to assist travel agencies with this recovery, the best solution for now would be to open up to allow many more inbound tourists in.\par \par \uc2 She believes that if the government does not aggressively push for the reopening of our borders, the inbound tourism industry will experience a late recovery and will be the industry that suffers the worst impact from the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Hotel occupancy was less than 30% in 2021\par \par \uc2 Malaysian Association of Hotels CEO Yap Lee Sheng(?) also agreed that the hotel industry in Malaysia is in urgent need of foreign tourists.\par \par \uc2 They said that 45% of tourists in Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s hotel industry are foreign tourists while the remaining 55% are domestic tourists. In the absence of foreign tourists, the market demand from domestic tourists is not enough to sustain the local hotel industry.\par \par \uc2 They also mentioned that the emergence of the Omicron variant has cause many countries to tighten restrictions and shutter their borders once again in order to stem the spread of the virus. This, in turn, will delay the reopening of international borders and has become a major concern for the hotel industry.\par \par \uc2 According to them, before the coronavirus pandemic, the average occupancy rate of hotels in Malaysia in 2019 was 64%. In 2020 as the pandemic struck and the national Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented, the average occupancy rate for hotels nationwide plunged by half to just 32%.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe were expecting a better recovery in 2021, not knowing that it would end up worse since another MCO was imposed from January to October and interstate travel was only recently reopened.\u8221\'20\'1D\u8220\'20\'1CIn 2021 we expected the average occupancy of hotels (for the entire year) to be under 30%.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He explained that at the moment, hotels in the country only have high occupancy rates on weekends or in areas with popular tourist attractions like Langkawi and Penang - but not elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs a whole, the hospitality industry is still struggling with small recoveries in operations but hardly any financial improvement.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The aviation industry\u8217\'20\'19s slow recovery\par \par \uc2 They admitted that the recovery process of Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s local aviation market is very slow and that of the international market is even worse. They are hoping the coronavirus situation will begin to stabilise more in the next few months.\par \par \uc2 Looking back on his experience in the last two years, Malindo Air CEO Mushafiz Mustafa Bakri said that all airline companies have been hit hard by this unprecedented pandemic. Malindo Air\u8217\'20\'19s revenue in March 2020 had tumbled by 95% compared to that of the previous year.\par \par \uc2 He told us that he originally believed that the coronavirus pandemic would pass quickly with an impact of just 4-6 months like the SARS pandemic. It ended up lasting for over two years.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Oriental Daily, he said that due to the sharp drop in revenue, the airline was forced to downsize and major adjustments were made including the reduction of aircraft and employees to reduce costs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe returned 20 Boeing 777s and three ATR-72s. Without these aircraft in service, we had to lay off some employees either through termination or a Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS). This has had a significant impact on our operations since 2020.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He admitted that while the recovery of the Malaysian aviation market was very slow, the international market was doing much worse. He hopes that the pandemic will simmer down and that things will stabilise in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe wanted a bottomed-out V-shaped recovery, but what we really got is more of an L-shaped recovery.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He said that the aviation industry is very concerned about the government\u8217\'20\'19s actions and response to this new Covid variant as the operation of the aviation industry depends on the actions of the government.\par \par \uc2 He hopes the government will not take a zero-tolerance approach in dealing with this Covid-19 variant as Malindo Air has opted to take a risk-based approach with the experience they have accrued over the last two years in dealing with Covid-19 and its variants.\par \par \uc2 The industry hopes the government and ASEAN to discuss the establishment of more VTLs to unify the cross-border tourism policies of various countries\par \par \uc2 In an effort to control the spread of the coronavirus outbreak across borders, Malaysia shuttered their international borders for nearly two years. The only exceptions are the Langkawi Tourism Bubble, which was only opened to foreign tourists in the second half of 2021 and the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) between Malaysia and Singapore.\par \par \uc2 These measures were not enough for Malaysian tourism companies who rely on foreign tourists, let along tourism companies that have suffered through this two year slump. To them, the domestic tourism industry can only fully recover when the borders are reopened.\par \par \uc2 Oriental Daily interviewed several representatives of the tourism sector who are hoping that the government will create more policies that will reset and revitalise the tourism industry.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Oriental Daily, Malindo Air CEO Mushafiz Mustafa Bakri said that the current obstacles in the way on the road to national recovery are the closure of the national borders and the different isolation, testing and vaccination requirements of various countries.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are calling on ASEAN countries to come to an agreement on travel documents, testing requirements, testing methods, vaccines and length of quarantine period.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He hopes that such an agreement will expedite the reopening of borders and once again allow the aviation industry to start flying again and once again connect ASEAN nations.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) between Malaysia and Singapore is an encouraging initiative. Hopefully we will be able to continue working with countries like Indonesia, Thailand and our other neighbours in ASEAN.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He said that recovery must be based on distance at this point of time and more emphasis needs to be placed on discussions with ASEAN nations.\par \par \uc2 He believes that countries should accept tourists who wish to enter and have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. It is only when people can once again move around without restriction can the tourism industry regain its momentum on the road to recovery.\par \par \uc2 Full recovery needs a strong leadership from MOTAC\par \par \uc2 Mint Leong, acting chairperson of the Malaysian Inbound Tourism Association pointed out that the \uc2 Ministry of Tourism\uc2  and Culture (MOTAC) must take the lead in the recovery of the tourism industry since a lot of communication and policymaking across departments and agencies have to be involved.\par \par \uc2 She emphasised that the full recovery of the tourism industry requires MOTAC to take a strong leadership role, to be responsible for communication and connection between various departments after taking into consideration the suggestions and concerns from industry leaders.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  has to start with the government. If the government does not allow Malaysians to travel abroad and foreign tourists to enter, it will be a complete failure as a ministry.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She is hoping that the government can negotiate with ASEAN countries to open up more tourist bubbles and flights and to make plans in advance to select suitable locations for tourist bubbles and target traveller groups.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe hope that the travel bubble in Langkawi can be extended to other places, quarantine should be reduced from 7 to 5 days. This safer environment will be able to help inbound tourism operators bring more customers in.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She suggested that Malaysia should refer to the tourism policies of some other countries in this pandemic such as those of more liberal countries like those in Europe and America to then craft a suitable model for Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s tourism industry.\par \par \uc2 An ASEAN travel visa has been proposed to allow for travel between 10 countries\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Malaysian Association of Hotels CEO Yap Lip Seng said that the association has repeatedly suggested that the ASEAN Tourism Association introduce a single visa for ASEAN countries in order to attract more foreign tourists.\par \par \uc2 He explained that tourists holding this visa should be allowed unimpeded travel to the 10 ASEAN countries without having to apply for separate visas, thus allowing more tourists to visit more ASEAN countries and spend more time here.\par \par \uc2 He said that this strategy is similar to the one adopted in European countries and can be an excellent strategy for the Malaysian tourism industry which has been highly dependent on foreign tourists and their high \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  power.\par \par \uc2 He pointed out that ASEAN can take advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to conduct a major reset of the tourism industry and to restart talks of collaborations between ASEAN nations to present itself as a destination as a whole.\par \par \uc2 He also said that ASEAN as a whole is a very competitive tourist destination because of the wide variety of attractions, cultures and natural heritage that are competitive with other travel destinations.\par \par \uc2 He pointed out that ASEAN member nations can work together to promote tourism in ASEAN through a clever marketing slogan being \u8220\'20\'1COne Vision, One Identity, One Community\u8221\'20\'1D when promoting and encouraging tourism in their respective countries.\par \par \uc2 He believes that as long as the 10 ASEAN countries can commit to this it will bring an influx of a large number of tourists and eventually benefit all ASEAN member nations.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Yap also said that Malaysia is very dependent on tourists from within ASEAN itself, especially from Singapore.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C70% of our tourists are from ASEAN and almost half of them are from Singapore.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He said that tourists from Singapore are not particularly helpful to the Malaysian hotel industry as they prefer to stay with their relative and friends in their homes instead.\par \par \uc2 He believes that Malaysia needs to revamp its strategy in order to reduce its reliance on Singaporean tourists and instead, look towards expanding to attract tourists from other key markets such as China, India, Japan and South Korea.\par \par \uc2 Prepare for and take measures to deal with the new wave of epidemics. The Minister of Tourism hopes to gradually reopen the border\par \par \uc2 Tourism is inseparable from travel. As such, the recovery of the tourism industry is directly connected to freedom of movement. With Malaysia reopening interstate travel on October 11 and the launch of the international tourism bubble and Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) in November, the recovery of the local tourism sector has gradually been picking up.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Nancy Shukri believes that with Malaysia on the road to becoming one of the countries in the world with the best vaccination rates in the world, the Langkawi International Tourism Bubble and Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) can potentially attract foreign tourists.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe hope that with the gradual reopening of borders such as the Langkawi International Tourism Bubble (LITB) on 15 November 2021, and the Malaysia-Singapore Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) on 29 November 2021, we will not only see an increase in tourists and tourism revenue but also help us inch closer to the complete reopening of our borders to foreign tourists.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In a written reply to a question from an Oriental Daily reporter, Nancy pointed out that as of December 21, 2021, over 600,000 domestic and foreign tourists have visited Langkawi with tourism revenue reaching RM640 million.\par \par \uc2 As of December 22, 2021, 1,089 tourists have visited Langkawi via the tourism bubble including tourists from the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, China, Germany, Indonesia and Thailand.\par \par \uc2 She also said that as of December 13, 2021, the Malaysia-Singapore VTL for air travel has brought 15,864 tourists to Malaysia. Meanwhile as of December 18, 2021, 22,003 tourists have come to Malaysia via the Malaysia-Singapore VTL on land.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are looking forward to expanding the VTL to other ASEAN countries when the conditions permit.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 However, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to temporarily suspend the sale of airline and bus tickets for the VTL from December 23, 2021 to January 20, 2022 due to a cluster of infections believes to have been from the Omicron mutation in Singapore.\par \par \uc2 Nancy also mentioned that according to the report by the Malaysian Hotels Association, the average hotel occupancy rate in the third quarter of 2021 had increased to nearly 30% compared to that of the second quarter in the same year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe interstate travel ban was lifted on October 11 and the average (hotel) occupancy rate has risen steadily to 45% in November.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She said that this was a good indicator of recovery and that given our international borders are still closed, it means that locals are beginning to adapt to the new normal in tourism.\par \par \uc2 She said that MOTAC is working on numerous strategies to boost domestic tourism including incentivised programmes in the form of discounts with local airlines, the Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH), rebates, gift voudhers as well as the purchase of cultural souvenirs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs of December 9, 2021, Malaysians have fully redeemed these rewards.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While ttourists have started to travel under the conditions of the new normal, Nancy Shukri urges tourists to follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) while travelling to ensure that the number of Covid-19 cases remains low so that tourism activities can continue to open.\par \par \uc2 She pointed out that with the new coronavirus variant, the government will always be prepared to take all the necessary measures before fully reopening our borders.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s active participation in the recovery of tourism in ASEAN\par \par \uc2 Nancy Shukri added that on the road to ASEAN\u8217\'20\'19s recovery, Malaysia has been actively participating in ASEAN-level discussions through the ASEAN National Tourism Organisation (NTO), its committees and working groups to propose mitigation and action plans in order to break the Covid-19 chain of infection and to continue the implementation of the ASEAN Tourism Strategic Plan (ATSP) from 2016 to 2025.\par \par \uc2 She pointed out that Malaysia is actively playing a key leadership role in executing strategic action plans on investment, sustainability and marketing matters under the ATSP, which in turn will enhance ASEAN\u8217\'20\'19s competitiveness as a single tourism destination.\par \par \uc2 She said that Malaysia is also working closely with all relevant ASEAN sectoral agencies to effectively and completely implement recovery plans and action and to ensure that policies and guidelines are aligned in order to jointly tackle the Covid-19 outbreak.\par \par \uc2 How the pandemic changed travel patterns towards health and safety\par \par \uc2 When discussing changes in future travel plans during the pandemic, Nancy pointed out that future travel patterns will definitely change and that travellers\u8217\'20\'19\u8217\'20\'19 preferences and activities will shift towards familiar, predictable, trustable and low-risk destinations, such as domestic and regional resort destinations, outdoor activities and ecotourism attractions.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSafe, uncrowded and comfortable destinations will have a surge in demand by travellers, giving rise to an opportunity to promote lesser-known destinations. Not only will this expand the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  benefits of tourism but also will solve the problem of crowds at popular attractions.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In the aftermath of the pandemic, health and safety will become important factors in attracting tourists who prefer destinations with good infrastructure, proper medical facilities and compliance with standards for cleanliness, health and safety, she said.\par \par \uc2 Citing Tourism Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s survey on domestic travel in Malaysia last year, she said that most respondents are of the belief that Covid-19 had affected their travel behaviour.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAlmost all respondents put health and safety as a high priority in their travel decisions and would avoid travelling to crowded places. Most respondents prefer to arrange their own travel through online booking services.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She believes that tourism operators must \u8220\'20\'1Cdramatically\u8221\'20\'1D review their business processes to adjust and adapt to new travel patterns during the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTravellers are seeking further support to face changing circumstances and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Travel operators are becoming more valuable and important in assisting travellers in making informed decisions.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She suggested that tourism operators remain flexible and to engage more with consumers and other stakeholders in order to overcome challenges and make travel enjoyable again which will in turn, encourage more tourists to travel.\par \par \uc2 This article is produced as a part of the SEAFORE ASEAN Masterclass project, with support from the \uc2 Institute for War and Peace Reporting\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2019/10/12/id_880108/880108_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020220111ei1b000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Survey respondents anxious over govt focus in view of 2024 elections prep\b0\par\par\uc2 647 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Members of the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  expect electoral politics to intensify this year in view of the 2024 elections, a recent survey shows, with many respondents expressing concern that increased politicking would detract the government's focus from the pandemic response.\par \par \uc2 The nationwide survey, which was conducted on Dec. 20-22 by the research and development division of Kompas daily, revealed that 71.9 percent of the respondents believed 2022 would be a political year as the country prepared for the 2024 elections. In addition, 73.1 percent of respondents expected political parties and presidential candidates to dial up their political campaigns this year.\par \par \uc2 The survey, which used a random sampling of 504 respondents aged 17 years and older from the country's 34 provinces, has a 4.37 percent margin of error.\par \par \uc2 The 2017 General Elections Law stipulates that election organizers should start preparing an election no later than 20 months before the polls. This means that the \uc2 General Elections Commission (KPU) \uc2 should start preparations for the 2024 elections this year amid the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  surrounding the election schedule.\par \par \uc2 The government and the KPU are currently at a deadlock over the election schedule. The government has proposed that the presidential and \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  elections be held on May 15 so it was closer to the date of the regional polls, which are to be held on an as yet undetermined date in November 2024.\par \par \uc2 The government cited political and security concerns as regards its proposed date, saying that a relatively lengthy duration between the national and regional elections would further polarize the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and thus pose a risk to political stability and national security.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, on September the KPU proposed that the presidential and \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  elections be held on Feb. 21, 2024. The commission indicated that it had designed the plan so as to provide enough time to resolve any election disputes, and possibly hold a second poll, before the early stages of November's regional polls began.\par \par \uc2 The General Elections Law authorizes the KPU to set the election schedule, but the commission must consult the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  before it formalizes the schedule in a KPU \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Kompas survey also highlighted respondents' concerns that preparations for the 2024 elections would distract the government from focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic as presidential hopefuls and political parties, including members of the government coalition, started intensifying their political campaigns.\par \par \uc2 While 44.4 percent of the respondents said they were concerned that election preparations would hamper the government's pandemic response, 36.1 percent expressed concern that national security and political stability would be affected as political rivalries heated up this year. Another 16.8 percent said they were concerned that political polarization would increase ahead of the elections.\par \par \uc2 Senior researcher Firman Noor, from the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) Center of Political Research, said political parties would likely start laying the groundwork this year to contest the 2024 elections, considering that the KPU was expected to open registration for presidential and \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  candidates in 2023.\par \par \uc2 "It is understandable that each political party [and candidate] aiming to take part in the presidential election in 2024 will start making preparations [in 2022]," Firman said on Monday.\par \par \uc2 He added that the behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts to forge political coalitions or secure grassroots support were expected to intensify in the latter half of the year.\par \par \uc2 Political and social change head Arya Fernandes from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Jakarta said he expected the government to maintain its focus on the pandemic response and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery strategy in 2022, despite increased politicking by political parties.\par \par \uc2 "Although 2024 election issues have started to gain \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  attention, the government will likely still focus on [handling the pandemic], considering it's a strategic issue [...]," he said.

\par\par \b \uc2 Investing in 2022: Omicron, Fed, your age matter\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas , The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 1,052 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Last year's global stock market rally and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  about the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery hasmany retail investors wondering whether it is time to shift to other asset classes.\par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post has asked investment professionals for their views on how to arrange a portfolio for the year ahead.\par \par \uc2 While there is no silver bullet and opinions vary, diversification is generally considered key to preparing for \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  times. Stocks, bonds, gold and other assets all have a place in a well-balanced portfolio, but the share of each may be adjusted depending on market developments and investors' personal risk appetite.\par \par \uc2 Analysts told the Post that retail investors should anticipate moves by the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2 , as monetary tightening by the US \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  would affect all types of investment, each with a different outcome.\par \par \uc2 A further recovery of domestic demand in Indonesia, on the other hand, could justify more exposure to Indonesian stocks, even though these would be considered riskier in the event of Fed tightening.\par \par \uc2 The emergence of new coronavirus variants would still have an impact on markets, albeit not as terrifyingly as earlier in the pandemic, as much of the risk is already factored into markets now.\par \par \uc2 PT Panin Sekuritas\uc2  analyst William Hartanto said on Wednesday that retail investors wanting to invest in the stock market could consider commodity-based companies, particularly in the oil and gas, coal and crude palm oil industries.\par \par \uc2 "Historically, markets would respond to Fed rate hikes by shifting investment to the commodity sector," said William, adding that a Fed rate hike was the single most impactful factor for investors to look out for at this time.\par \par \uc2 The sectors of consumer goods and manufacturing could be viable options, but retail investors should keep an eye on macroeconomic indicators affecting these two sectors.\par \par \uc2 For now, these indicators looked to be pointing in the right direction amid the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery following the pandemic, he said, but retail investors were advised to ensure this remained the case further into the year.\par \par \uc2 Despite driving the \uc2 Indonesia Stock Exchange\uc2  (IDX) Composite index last year, tech stocks did not make William's list. The analyst explained that these stocks had been the IDX's prime movers since 2020 and were in an overbought phase, resulting in limited scope for increase and a risk of sell-offs.\par \par \uc2 With regard to upcoming tech listings, William advised retail investors to study the price trend closely rather than relying on hype. He noted that many investors had suffered significant losses in the first e-commerce initial \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  offering (IPO) last year.\par \par \uc2 Retail investors\par \par \uc2 PT TRFX Garuda Berjangka director Ibrahim said on Wednesday that retail investors ought to watch out for possible hikes in COVID-19 cases due to the recent Omicron variant, which could disrupt the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery and cause the rupiah to depreciate. This included rising Omicron cases in other parts of the world.\par \par \uc2 He estimated that the gold price could go as far as US$2,000 per ounce or Rp 1 million ($69.80) per gram in 2022, up from around Rp 850,000 in early January. A dovish Fed stance or growing geopolitical concerns could increase the likelihood of gold to rise.\par \par \uc2 "We could see Omicron affect the rupiah, which would be followed by rising gold prices [in rupiah]," Ibrahim said on Wednesday to explain why retail investors should consider gold for investment.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Wahyu Tri Laksono, founder of trader community Traderindo,said if \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  hit the markets, reduced risk appetite could lead to a shift to risk-averse investments like gold, which might trigger a rise in demand. Alternatively, government bonds and other fixed-income assets could serve the same purpose.\par \par \uc2 PT Anugerah Sekuritas head of fixed income Ramdhan Ario Maruto said on Thursday that, despite \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2022 being lower than before, low-risk assets like government bonds were worthwhile.\par \par \uc2 He argued that the upcoming Fed tapering and rate hike would trigger a rise in \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  in many other countries, resulting in yields on financial instruments rising as well.\par \par \uc2 "Since we are part of the global market, we will be affected as well," Ramdhan said.\par \par \uc2 In Indonesia, global rate hikes would trigger an increase in \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2 's benchmark rate as well and push up government bond yields in 2022.\par \par \uc2 He predicted the yield on 10-year government bonds would rise to between 6.7 and 6.8 percent from 6.41 percent as of Jan. 12.\par \par \uc2 Andy Nugroho, financial planner at Advisors Alliance Group Indonesia, said on Friday that retail investors should also arrange their portfolios in line with their personal risk profile.\par \par \uc2 An aggressive investor who could tolerate more risk could allocate 70 to 80 percent of their portfolio to stocks, and the rest to government bonds, gold or fixed-income assets.\par \par \uc2 "Our \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  has rebound; industries have risen, and many analysts are optimistic about the Indonesian stock market. Therefore, those with an aggressive stance could put more in stocks," Andy told the Post.\par \par \uc2 Moderate-risk investors could allocate around 60 percent to government bonds, and the rest to fixed-income and balanced mutual funds, which are hybrid funds consisting of equity and bonds.\par \par \uc2 Conservative investors meanwhile could keep half of their portfolio in government bonds, followed by a quarter each in gold and money market mutual funds.\par \par \uc2 Financial planner and founder of Finansia Consulting Eko Endarto said on Friday that retail investors might need different approaches based on age.\par \par \uc2 Age matters\par \par \uc2 For those aged 20 to 30, Eko advised a 75 percent share of high-risk investment products like stocks, followed by 15 percent in medium risk options like gold or fixed-income and the rest in low-risk assets like government bonds, deposits and money market mutual funds.\par \par \uc2 For people aged 30 to 50, the portion of medium-risk investment could be upped to 20 percent, lowering the high-risk share to 70 percent. He advised people above 50 to opt for 15 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for low and medium risk assets, while the rest would go to high risk.\par \par \uc2 "The younger you are, the smaller the risk is. You could still switch jobs easily or remain fit compared to people aged 40 and beyond," Eko told the Post.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220116ei1h0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Trade surplus hits 14-year high in 2021\b0\par\par\uc2 Dzulfiqar Fathur Rahman, The Jakarta Post, London \par \uc2 644 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia recorded in 2021 its highest goods trade surplus since 2007 as commodity prices surged amid the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Statistics Indonesia (BPS) reported Monday that the country's exports reached US$231.54 billion and imports $196.20 billion in 2021. This resulted in a surplus worth $35.34 billion, the highest since $39.63 billion reached in 2007.\par \par \uc2 "We hope we can maintain this trend or increase it," BPS head Margo Yuwono said in a press briefing on Monday. "Of course, this will help with the government's efforts to restore the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  faster, as we all expect."\par \par \uc2 The record trade surplus took place amid surging commodity prices, including Indonesia's key export commodities of coal and crude palm oil (CPO), amid the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery, especially in developed countries.\par \par \uc2 Newcastle coal futures, for example, peaked at $269.50 per ton on Oct. 5, 2021, according to data published by \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  data provider Trading Economics. The index has returned to its late October level recently.\par \par \uc2 Mining exports therefore grew by 92.15 percent to $37.92 billion in 2021 from a year earlier, BPS data show. This was the fastest growth, followed by oil and gas, manufacturing and agriculture.\par \par \uc2 Overall, exports rose by 41.88 percent and imports by 38.59 percent in 2021, according to BPS. Import growth indicates further signs of recovery at home as consumers and businesses resumed activities.\par \par \uc2 Raw material imports grew the fastest at 42.80 percent to $147.38 billion in 2021, BPS reported Monday. This was followed by consumption and capital goods imports.\par \par \uc2 The growth in raw material and capital goods imports was in line with the expansion in factory activity, as reflected in the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 53.5 in December, according to London-based business information provider \uc2 IHS Markit\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Trade volumes also rose. This means there was also an increase in demand as the majority of economies have opened. This is in line with the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery," said Bank Mandiri economist Faisal Rachman on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Monthly slowdown\par \par \uc2 Even though the full-year figure hit a record high, the trade surplus in December 2021 dropped 51.5 percent year-on-year (yoy) to $1.02 billion, the smallest surplus since May 2020.\par \par \uc2 Economists at \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  noted the monthly trade surplus was both far below the expectations of the state-owned lender at $3.16 billion and of the market at $3.13 billion.\par \par \uc2 Exports reached $22.38 billion in December, up 35.3 percent yoy but down 2.04 percent month-to-month (mtm), mainly due to lower demand for coal and palm oil from China, which saw fresh lockdowns imposed in some regions with COVID-19 case spikes in late 2021. But an increase in CPO exports to Pakistan, Egypt and India helped buoy overall monthly exports.\par \par \uc2 Imports reached $21.36 billion in December, up 47.93 percent yoy and up 10.51 percent mtm as \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity strengthened following relaxed \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity restrictions (PPKM) and expanded vaccine drives.\par \par \uc2 Narrowing surplus\par \par \uc2 Economists expect Indonesia's trade surplus to narrow in 2022 as commodity prices cool and as imports pick up amid a global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Prices of coal, CPO and metals are expected to normalize this year as a result of rising supply even as domestic consumption and raw material imports are projected to pick up.\par \par \uc2 Kathrina Ell, senior Asia-Pacific economist at financial intelligence firm Moody's Analytics, said supply chain stress was forecast to continue easing in the first half of the year, citing improvements in indicators such as port traffic and supplier delivery times.\par \par \uc2 However, Ell noted that the Omicron coronavirus variant had increased \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and subsequently, the risk that supply chain issues would worsen.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220117ei1i0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 ASEAN poised for post-pandemic inclusive growth, prosperity\b0\par\par\uc2 1,085 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Joo-ok Lee , Geneva\par \par \uc2 The COVID-19 pandemic caused global investment activities to fall -- due to \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , lockdowns, supply chain disruptions and postponement of investment by multinational enterprises.\par \par \uc2 ASEAN also recorded a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2020 to US$137 billion, down from its highest-ever inflow of $182 billion in 2019 when it was the largest recipient of FDI in the developing world.\par \par \uc2 Despite the decline, ASEAN remained an attractive investment destination.\par \par \uc2 The region's share of global FDI rose from 11.9 percent in 2019 to 13.7 percent in 2020, while the intra-ASEAN share of FDI in the region increased from 12 percent to 17 percent.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, the longer-term trend shows that the value of international project finance in ASEAN has doubled from an annual average of $37 billion in 2015-2017 to an annual average of $74 billion in 2018-2020.\par \par \uc2 And the future looks bright. According to the first-of-its-kind ASEAN Development Outlook (ADO) report, the total combined gross domestic product (GDP) of 10 ASEAN countries in 2019 was valued at $3.2 trillion -- making ASEAN the fifth-largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the world, well on track to become the fourth largest by 2030.\par \par \uc2 With a total population of about 700 million people, 61 percent are under the age of 35 -- and the majority of young people are embracing digital technologies into their daily activities.\par \par \uc2 The outlook remains promising, with coordinated pandemic response efforts and several key developments underway in the region.\par \par \uc2 ASEAN members took coordinated actions to respond to pandemic challenges, such as the Hanoi Plan of Action on Strengthening ASEAN \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Cooperation and Supply Chain Connectivity in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Members collaborated on the flow of essential goods and enhanced the resilience of its supply chains and sourcing in the region.\par \par \uc2 This joint response was critical given how the concentration of FDI in ASEAN is connected to global value chain activities or regional production networks that involve intra- and inter-firm linkages.\par \par \uc2 To support recovery and resilience building, ASEAN launched the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund and cooperated with external partners on the ASEAN Centre for \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases (ACPHEED) to enhance regional health security and to sustain ASEAN preparedness and resilience in the face of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  health emergencies.\par \par \uc2 The ASEAN-led \uc2 Regional Comprehensive \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Partnership\uc2  (RCEP) Agreement came into force on Jan. 1 for Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Japan, Lao PDR, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. With it, ASEAN resolves to keep markets open while strengthening regional \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  integration toward post-pandemic inclusive recovery.\par \par \uc2 RCEP is the biggest regional free trade agreement in existence and will cover 30 percent of global GDP and 30 percent of the world population in addition to accounting for over one-quarter of global trade in goods and services.\par \par \uc2 Key provisions addresse liberalizing and promoting intra-RCEP trade, investment and services as well as developing e-commerce, which is highly relevant for regional value chains and market -- and efficiency-seeking investment.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, non-RCEP companies can also take advantage of RCEP benefits by locating and operating in the region.\par \par \uc2 Considering that 40 percent of investment in ASEAN comes from RCEP members -- of which 24 percent comes from non-ASEAN RCEP member countries -- opportunities exist to boost more sustainable FDI in the region, particularly value chain-linked FDI taking into account the benefits of RCEP and the recently concluded ASEAN Investment Facilitation Framework (AIFF).\par \par \uc2 The recent adoption of the Consolidated Strategy on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) for ASEAN during the 38th and 39th ASEAN Summits and the ASEAN Agreement on Electronic Commerce will advance the region's push for digital transformation and private investment in digital infrastructure development (5G networks and data centers), cloud computing, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing.\par \par \uc2 The ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework (ACRF) identified digital connectivity as a priority to facilitate regional connectivity and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 This correlated to the findings of a survey of 86,000 people from six ASEAN countries conducted by the \uc2 World \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Forum\uc2  and Sea, which found respondents (including business owners) who were "more digitalized" tended to be more economically resilient during the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 However, the survey also found several barriers to digital adoption including affordable access to quality internet and digital devices.\par \par \uc2 The forum is addressing this global issue through initiatives like the EDISON Alliance, which mobilizes multi stakeholder collaboration to expand digital access to more than 1 billion people by 2025.\par \par \uc2 The ASEAN Digital Integration Framework will also support the ACRF. The forum has been completing ASEAN efforts through the Digital ASEAN Initiative on data \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , digital skills, e-payments and cybersecurity.\par \par \uc2 The forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, which brings stakeholders together to maximize the benefits of technology while reducing potential risks, have shown that \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 -private cooperation is instrumental for businesses and government to develop cooperative ecosystems to advance digital transformation and innovation.\par \par \uc2 Governments have an important role in incentivizing investments in research and development, while the private sector will drive Industry 4.0 transformation through investing in digitalization of manufacturing, using advanced manufacturing solutions, building smart factories and establishing R&D facilities, technology hubs, and centers of excellence in the region.\par \par \uc2 Embracing 4IR also requires a parallel commitment to environmental sustainability. This can establish new forms of efficiency wherein sustainability and competitive excellence are not only compatible, but, in fact, intertwined.\par \par \uc2 A green future does not only benefit the well-being of the next ASEAN generation but is also good for ASEAN economically, boosting the region's competitiveness in attracting green FDIs to address new climate-related investment and trade measures adopted by developed economies.\par \par \uc2 ASEAN has shown strong commitment towards climate change and global sustainability efforts.\par \par \uc2 Several initiatives support ASEAN's sustainable ambitions, including the Global Plastic Action Partnership in Indonesia and Vietnam.\par \par \uc2 However, greater commitment to environmental stewardship is also required from the private sector to design corporate purchasing commitments that can drive investment in green technologies and market demand for low-carbon tech to help ASEAN meet climate-related goals.\par \par \uc2 The First Movers Coalition launched during COP26 could offer valuable insights for ASEAN on how the private sector can drive decarbonization in different industries and societies in the region.\par \par \uc2 _______________\par \par \uc2 Head of Asia-Pacific at \uc2 World \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Forum\uc2  (WEF).

Hence, the policies and supervisions issued by the OJK need to stop the pervasive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic," the president remarked during the online 2022 financial services industry"s annual meeting and the launch of green taxonomy here on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The president deemed it necessary to have in place a more specific strategy for handling or mitigating the wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic, as some sectors have suffered lingering strikes.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, during the pandemic, the global supply chain was disrupted that led to an increase in the global commodity prices and global inflation, he added.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi highlighted the improvement in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance in the real sector. However, all parties are urged to remain vigilant to the developments in COVID-19, especially transmission of the new variant, Omicron.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  still reels from several \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , such as scarcities in food, energy resources, and containers in some countries.\par \par \uc2 Problems, such as inflation in the production prices, should be addressed, as Indonesia is also impacted by them, according to Jokowi.\par \par \uc2 The event of the online 2022 financial services industry annual meeting and the launch of green taxonomy was conducted in hybrid mode, both online and offline. Jokowi gave directives remotely from the Bogor Presidential Palace in West Java.\par \par \uc2 The meeting was attended by OJK"s Chairman of Commissioners Board Wimboh Santoso, the ministers of Jokowi"s cabinet, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2 , and several financial services industry players.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-KZU/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 20-01-2022 15:27:10\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220120ei1k000p2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 decided to keep its key rate, or BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR), unchanged at 3.5 percent during its meeting of board of governors on January 19-20, 2022.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  also maintained the deposit facility rate at 2.75 percent and lending facility rate at 4.25 percent.\par \par \uc2 "This decision is relevant to the need to maintain the stability of inflation rate, exchange rate, and financial system as well as an effort to boost \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in the midst of increasing external pressures," BI Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  noted during a press conference here on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Warjiyo remarked that the 2021 inflation remained low and supported \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  stability, with the consumer price index (IHK) recorded at 1.87 percent. The 2021 inflation was lower year-on-year as compared to the previous year and was below the target range of two to four percent.\par \par \uc2 He attributed the development to less strong domestic demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stable exchange rate, controllable inflation, adequate supplies, smooth foodstuff distribution, and synergy between the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the government to maintain price stability.\par \par \uc2 Warjiyo forecast the 2022 inflation rate to still be kept under control in the range of two to four percent in line with aggregate supply that is still sufficient to meet the rising demand in addition to the expectations of controllable inflation, stable exchange rate, and positive responses to the policies to the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  and government.\par \par \uc2 "BI is committed to maintaining price stability and strengthening coordination with the government through central and regional inflation controlling teams to keep the inflation and IHK within their target range," he stated.\par \par \uc2 Warjiyo noted that the rupiah"s exchange rate was also kept under control owing to BI"s stabilization steps and resilience of Indonesia"s external sector amid continued \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  about the global financial markets.\par \par \uc2 The rupiah weakened 0.77 percent point-to-point and 0.01 percent on a pro rata basis on January 19, 2022, as compared to December 2021. However, the rupiah still performed better as compared to the currencies of several other developing nations.\par \par \uc2 (T.H-SHT/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 20-01-2022 20:03:45\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220120ei1k001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

Indonesian oil production peaked at 1.68 million bpd in 1981.\par \par \uc2 Forget for a moment the conveniently made long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 or 2060. Even the 23 percent target for renewable energy in our national energy mix by 2025 seems still a pipe dream as the current realization is a mere 11 percent.\par \par \uc2 However unpopular it is now to talk about fossil fuels and the hydrocarbon sector, energy analysts still project oil will continue to be the main fuel in the transportation sector in Indonesia even until 2040.\par \par \uc2 Look how addicted we have become to cheap (subsidized) gasoline. As government leaders and most politicians are so obsessed with the five-year political cycle in the national leadership, they do not have the courage to consistently implement a long-term strategy to phase out fossil fuel \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In fact, the government itself has set the role of natural gas, which is cleaner burning than oil, in power generation at 25 percent in 2030, up from about 20 percent at present. Oil and gas also still account for about 10 percent of total government \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  and nontax revenues.\par \par \uc2 The Upstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Special Task Force (SKKMigas) has set the oil output target at 1 million bpd and gas at 12 billion standard cubic feet (scf) in 2030. Natural gas production last year totaled 5.5 billion scf. The 2030 production targets require an annual investment of US$25 billion for the next eight years.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, Chevron's Indonesia Deepwater Development in the Makassar Strait and \uc2 Shell\uc2 's Masela gas block in Maluku, which are now in limbo are two of the four largest gas development projects in the country.\par \par \uc2 Latest SKKMigas reports show that the investment target for the upstream oil industry in 2022 is only $13.2 billion, up from $10.70 billion in 2021. Yet more worrisome is that only $1 billion of the total investment will be made in exploration. Last year only two of six oil concessions put to open tender or direct offer were taken up by investors.\par \par \uc2 Most oil executives and analysts agree Indonesia still has many sedimentary basins with large potential \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  and good geological prospects. But huge investments in exploration are required to turn the potential resources into proven oil and gas \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 However, national companies do not have adequate financing or the technological capacity to conduct major exploration activities. Since it is only a small chance that money spent on exploration will have a commercial return, virtually no national banks are willing to lend to hydrocarbon prospecting operations due to the high risks and the long gestation (payback) period of the business.\par \par \uc2 The departure of the three oil giants will certainly affect foreign investor confidence in the country and this is quite damaging to the petroleum industry because only international oil firms with their high credit ratings and global networks are willing to invest the required sums in high-risk oil and gas prospecting.\par \par \uc2 "The main challenge now is that the capital available for oil and gas investment has decreased because companies have to shift part of their resources to renewable energy," Indonesian Petroleum Association (IPA) executive director Marjolijn "Meity" Wajong told The Jakarta Post last week.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, oil firms are now required to implement carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies to cut emissions in production operations. All this will increase production costs, she added.\par \par \uc2 The government has made significant improvements in the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and bureaucracy of the petroleum industry but investors demand better terms and conditions due to the dramatic change in the oil and gas landscape amid the strengthening global green commitments.\par \par \uc2 Legal and regulatory \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and inefficient bureaucracy are especially inimical to investors in the upstream segment of the hydrocarbon industry--exploration and mining -- as this business involves high risks, requires big capital and has a very long payback period.\par \par \uc2 With the climate crisis hastening a global shift to cleaner energy, fossil fuels will likely be cheaper than expected in the coming decades, while their carbon emissions will get more expensive. These two simple assumptions mean that tapping many oil fields, which were previously commercially viable, no longer makes \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sense.\par \par \uc2 The paradox though is that there seems to be a mounting resource nationalism among politicians as can be seen in the granting to state-owned \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  the right of first refusal for expiring productive oil and gas concessions.\par \par \uc2 This trend frustrates many foreign companies, they feel they are no longer welcome as their contracts are not being extended and their complaints about heavy-handed micro management are not being heeded.\par \par \uc2 _________________\par \par \uc2 A senior editor at The Jakarta Post\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220123ei1o00004\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Why We Don\u8217\'20\'19t Need the New Capital\b0\par\par\uc2 663 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 January 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 THERE are many reasons why the project to move the state capital city should be opposed. Therefore, there needs to be a legal challenge to the decision taken by the administration of President Joko Widodo and approved by the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR) in order to prevent the damage it will cause.\par \par \uc2 The decision and the process to move the capital city clearly does not meet the definition of good governance. The law serving as the legal basis for the project was drawn up in a reckless fashion. It is very clear that the government and the DPR ignored the principles of establishing laws, especially that of transparency. There was very little \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  participation in the drawing up of this \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , even after the plan to move the capital was announced by President Joko Widodo in 2019. The results of a government study into the plan have never been made \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After the bill to move the state capital city was sent to the DPR, there were no genuine efforts by the government and the legislature to ask for inputs from the people. This is despite the fact that the plan to move the capital city to East Kalimantan would cost Rp466.9 trillion, and at least 20 percent of that would come from \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  funds. Deliberations began on December 7, 2021, after the special committee was established, and the bill was passed on January 18. This relatively brief duration gives the impression that the deliberations were carried out in secret.\par \par \uc2 It is believed that moving the capital city would damage the drainage system, destroy habitats of plants and animals and cause pollution. Penajam Paser, the proposed location for the capital, is a water catchment area that contributes to the water supply in the region, including for Balikpapan. There is bound to be a clearing of forest cover in the location and surrounding areas. Deforestation is an increasing threat to the landscape of the region, which is surrounded by mining, forestry and oil palm concessions.\par \par \uc2 From the cost aspect, the construction of the new capital will be a burden on state finances. At a time of widening \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 , most of which is the result of handling the Covid-19 pandemic and the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery program, adding a new \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  item is not a wise decision. The proposal by Finance Minister Sri Mulyani to include the funding for the construction of the new capital city in the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery program is not a sensible one. According to the regulations, this program is intended to protect and revive the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  during the pandemic. Construction of the new capital city does not fall under these criteria.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, there is no guarantee that the proportion originating from state funds, 20 percent, would not increase. The remaining 80 percent is projected to come from state-owned, regional and private enterprises as well as from cooperation between the government and businesses. Experience has shown that a number of projects initially funded by government-owned companies ended with injections of state funds. Cooperation between the government and businesses also means there must be return on investment for these companies. In short, the state would still have to put its hand in its pocket.\par \par \uc2 The government\u8217\'20\'19s excuse that the capital city is being moved to bring about equality is debatable. It will be difficult to achieve equality because the city to be built would not be a center of business. And this reasoning looks even more \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  because for the last 20 years we have had regional autonomy and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  decentralization as means to trigger equality of growth. The government has developed special \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  regions to create growth centers.\par \par \uc2 At this point, we can ask questions about the real motive behind the rush to move the capital. These questions will remain unanswered because of the obscure nature of this project since it was first proposed.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/01/24/793022/793022_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220124ei1o00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Insider view: Will local music festivals make triumphant return this year?\b0\par\par\uc2 1,656 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Raka Ibrahim, Contributor, Denpasar\par \par \uc2 Flashing lights, blaring speakers and masses of color. The image is familiar to the millions who have longed for their return for nearly two years now.\par \par \uc2 "Music festivals are all about celebration. That's why it's harder for them to make a comeback," said Rizky Aulia, better known as "Ucup".\par \par \uc2 If anyone knows anything about the huge effort and resources it would take to organize a music festival in these trying times, it's him. Ucup has had a hand in founding some of the country's hippest festivals and has a finger firmly on the industry's pulse. But when faced with the inevitable question, even an optimist like Ucup becomes skeptical.\par \par \uc2 "The return of music festivals is still very much a gray area," he said. "People are just waiting for a trigger, then things will set off."\par \par \uc2 When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the country in March 2020, its bustling music industry ground to a halt. As amplifiers and drum sets gathered dust in a corner backstage, musicians and promoters who rely on touring for the bulk of their incomes also found themselves in a corner.\par \par \uc2 Facing imminent financial ruin and an \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  future, industry insiders say that the forced hiatus has gone on for far too long. Something has to give, and soon.\par \par \uc2 Canceled hopes\par \par \uc2 It was only late last year that industry players saw a dim light at the end of the tunnel. COVID-19 numbers went down, \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  restrictions were eased and music promoters sensed a rare opening.\par \par \uc2 "The demand was big, and it has persisted," recalled Wendi Putranto, program director and cofounder of M-Bloc, arguably Jakarta's top up-and-coming cultural venue.\par \par \uc2 "People felt better about going to concerts because the [coronavirus] case numbers were going down and the media were keeping things conducive," he said.\par \par \uc2 In late November 2021, M-Bloc hosted sold-out concerts of indie superstars Kunto Aji and Hindia. Electro-pop crooner Pamungkas also pounced on the chance, announcing a monthlong, 12-city tour across Java that would end in December.\par \par \uc2 Then, a statement concert was held on Dec. 20, featuring "dangdut king" Rhoma Irama and his lavish backing band Soneta sharing the stage with hard rock legends God Bless. Tourism and Creative \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister \uc2 Sandiaga Uno\uc2  came to the venue, his escorts in tow, posing for pictures with Rhoma while "ensuring the procedures and health protocols were followed", according to his social media post that night.\par \par \uc2 The two musical pantheons capped a glorious night as thousands danced, and it seemed the sky was the limit.\par \par \uc2 "The enthusiasm was crazy," recalled Ucup, who masterminded that concert under the banner of his new event organizing company, Boss Creator. "People really missed going to concerts."\par \par \uc2 These one-off concerts and low-key, stripped-back tours were considered the "dress rehearsal" before the real thing returned: large-scale music festivals. Opportunities abounded during this small sliver of hope, even for smaller collectives and independent organizers with tight budgets and even tighter space for errors.\par \par \uc2 "The paths were already open for [independent] promoters to bring musicians, even from abroad," said Argia Adhidhanendra, cofounder of music promoter collective Noisewhore. "But then the new variant [Omicron] dropped, and bands worldwide began canceling their tours."\par \par \uc2 That was when the wave of hope broke and rolled back. The caseload grew after the festive period and Jakarta imposed the level 2 \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity restrictions (PPKM), worrying industry insiders.\par \par \uc2 "If it got to level 3, all cultural and arts events will be banned by the central government," said Wendi of M-Bloc. "For promoters, it was too much of a gamble."\par \par \uc2 But the ball was already rolling. "As far as I've heard, a lot of music festivals are already plotting a comeback for after Idul Fitri," said Ucup, referring to the major Muslim holiday that falls in May this year.\par \par \uc2 "There are even rumors going around about which artists will be coming from abroad. You've got people saying this band is playing here, another band is playing a stadium opening and a lot more."\par \par \uc2 There is a sense that many industry players are too restless to bear another enforced shutdown.\par \par \uc2 "We do have plans for organizing an offline music festival this year," said Pratista Ayu of marketing and promotions at events behemoth Ismaya Live. "There's a huge demand from the Indonesian audience for the return of offline music festivals."\par \par \uc2 "Foreign bands and booking agents are targeting Indonesia because they think we're a loyal, consumptive market with buying power that defies logic," Ucup emphasized. "Indonesia is like someone who has been fasting for a long time. [The audience] is hungry, and they'll eat up anything."\par \par \uc2 Cautionary voices\par \par \uc2 Some quarters, however, don't share Ismaya Live's relentless drive or Ucup's optimistic outlook.\par \par \uc2 "The capital is there, sponsors are sensing an opportunity and the audience's appetite is big," said Argia. "But right now, the market is the only argument for festivals to return. There's a ton of hurdles and the only counter to that is to say that the promoters and audience want that to happen."\par \par \uc2 There are ethical reasons for caution, of course, but more practical issues, too. Although the government recently reduced the 10-day mandatory quarantine for all overseas travelers to 7 days, booking agents had begun to have second thoughts about sending their artists to Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 "Even if the band really wants to come, their booking agent will shoot that idea down," said Wendi. "There's no way they'll let their band spend seven days in Indonesia just to quarantine."\par \par \uc2 Ucup acknowledged that the country's quarantine rules were a major stumbling block for international bands. "It's the main concern for booking agents," he conceded. "They don't really consider the pandemic [as an issue]. It's just the quarantine rules. If [the band] has to stay in a hotel and quarantine for a week, that's time that could be spent touring several countries."\par \par \uc2 This also means that no one else aside from heavyweight promoters can afford inviting a foreign band.\par \par \uc2 "For high-tier acts, it's possible for them to come as a one-off [show]," Argia says. "But that's not going to happen in the case of up-and-coming artists who are on an intense touring schedule." Doing so would simply be economically unfeasible for the artist, booking agent and promoters alike.\par \par \uc2 Wendi was also worried that the recent spike in cases would make sponsors more cautious about supporting concerts and festivals.\par \par \uc2 "Festivals are guaranteed to attract a crowd, and Omicron spreads like wildfire," he said. "Promoters must be concerned that their shows could become new clusters of infection."\par \par \uc2 They would likely hold back, he continued, which would close the curtain on most music promoters who were still reeling financially from almost two years of forced inactivity.\par \par \uc2 "There's still a huge reliance on sponsors here," Wendi underlined, adding that without sponsor funding, even the industry heavyweights would struggle to stay afloat.\par \par \uc2 Finding the middle ground\par \par \uc2 For Ucup, it all hinges on the government providing clarity. "The government needs to explicitly say that [music festivals] are allowed and under what conditions they can be [held]," he says. "As long as [the government] remains silent, there's a sense that these promoters are defying the law."\par \par \uc2 He points to Pamungkas' year-end tour and the upcoming Joyland Festival, a music festival to be held in Bali in February, as examples of what could be done with support and clear guidance from the government. Both are relatively smaller events that had the blessing of local authorities.\par \par \uc2 "Even the [tourism] minister has attended my concerts," Ucup said, praising authorities' tentative support for the return of cultural events. "But festivals require bigger assurances from policymakers."\par \par \uc2 A tourism ministry representative has not responded to The Jakarta Post's request for comments.\par \par \uc2 "People in the industry already have their own plans for 2022," Ucup said. "They're just waiting on the situation around Idul Fitri. They even have their own plans for ensuring that the health protocols are followed during the festivals."\par \par \uc2 Pratista admitted that concerns over health and safety, along with ambiguity over permits, had plunged many well-laid plans into \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We need to know if the government accepts the proposed health protocol plans drawn up by promoters," she said. "Then, it's up to us to make sure these protocols are implemented effectively and efficiently."\par \par \uc2 For Argia, though, these aspirations seem foolhardy at best and impractical at worst.\par \par \uc2 "Will there be mandatory testing at these festivals, for example?" he asked. "And if so, how will that affect the costs? How expensive will the tickets be then, and will it make \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sense?"\par \par \uc2 Jakarta was "70 percent ready" for festivals to return, he noted.\par \par \uc2 "We have the infrastructure, experienced promoters who are used to strange policies and audiences who are well-versed in the health protocols and understand the importance of mandatory testing. But if Jakarta starts something, I guarantee other cities will follow. Are they just as ready? Will their promoters and local government be as strict?" Argia said.\par \par \uc2 "We are being relatively healthy as a whole. Do we want to risk what we have now?\par \par \uc2 "It's a selfish urge to see shows [in person]. Considering the optics, the logistics and the track record of promoters and regulators, it seems like it won't be a good experiment."\par \par \uc2 For Wendi, the music industry needs to face up to reality and start plotting a more gradual return, focusing on one-off concerts and hyping up long-suffering local musicians instead of forcing grandiose festivals that featured international artists.\par \par \uc2 "We have to be realistic. It's time to take small steps," he said. "At least we're moving, and we get to keep our sanity."\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220124ei1p0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

The downstreaming concept has been applied in palm oil, nickel ore, aluminum and petrochemical commodities, he highlighted.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, he affirmed that for tackling the problems of climate change, the government had targeted the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by issuing Presidential \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 98 of 2021 to reduce the carbon emission rates.\par \par \uc2 In terms of regulations, the Indonesian government has made the Job Creation Law effective that eases the process of investment through risk-based licensing, he stated.\par \par \uc2 Pandjaitan also ensured that the government will continue to prepare attractive incentive schemes to bolster domestic and foreign investment.\par \par \uc2 "I am optimistic that investors would not hesitate to contact me when they face difficulties in investing," he added.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-KZU/A/H-SHT/H-SHT) 25-01-2022 19:25:05\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220125ei1p001gt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 G20 Indonesia 2022: The opportunity to address food, nutrition and climate\b0\par\par\uc2 1,210 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Felia Salim and Rina Agustina , Jakarta\par \par \uc2 On a recent stopover in Indonesia, Mari Pangestu, managing director of the World Bank, shared some hard facts facing the world. The pandemic had a two-track impact last year: Developed countries achieved pre-pandemic growth rates in 2021, while most developing nations did not. Around 100 million people live in extreme poverty today, while a shocking disparity in vaccination rates persists, as well asmajor impacts on human capital -- from the lack of effective access to online education and health services.\par \par \uc2 The emerging variant is causing further \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , prolonging the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  impact of the pandemic and possibly affecting overall global growth for years to come. While business-as-usual is no longer a choice when addressing climate and sustainability, the world also needs to ready itself for future pandemics.\par \par \uc2 Taking charge of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  presidency this month, Indonesia has the chance to be a leading light on the world stage when it comes to the vital and interlocking issues of climate, health, nutrition, rural development, forests, nature and land use. All these issues revolve around the choices made by Indonesia and the world as to how food is produced, processed, distributed and consumed.\par \par \uc2 The G20 presidency of Indonesia has already set out some of the key elements of its plans on climate, the environment and agriculture in a series of position papers. These include a welcome focus on the need for climate action with international support for the just transitionand the need to ensure greater food systemresilience in the face of a changing climate.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian presidency has also made an important case for more intense global action to address food insecurity, noting the negative impacts and long-lasting scarring effects that COVID-19 and the subsequent \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  downturns have had on hunger and malnutrition worldwide.\par \par \uc2 Decisive domestic action is always a powerful way of displaying global leadership, and in 2022, Indonesia has the opportunity to show the world how to make significant progress in these areas. Recent reports (including \uc2 World Food Program\uc2  or WFP, 2021; \uc2 World Bank\uc2 , 2021; Agustina et al 2019) have shown Indonesia's substantial progress over the last decade in reducing poverty and improving health indicators.\par \par \uc2 However, the COVID-19 pandemic is turning back the clock. We speak of the lost decade of growth for most emerging nations, and Indonesia faces serious challenges in food security and nutrition, with persistent regional disparities in the availability and affordability of nutritious foods (WFP, 2021). This makes it harder than ever to address the triple burden of malnutrition, leading to persistent and high child stunting and wasting rates, to high micronutrient deficiencies in the wider populationand rapidly increasing obesity.\par \par \uc2 To improve access to nutritious foods for all, especially those most vulnerable to malnutrition, such as infants, young children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly, food system transformation is essential.This means doing a better job of linking choices in agriculture and land use to health and climate change, with food as the common denominator.Many reports, including those from the Food and Land Use Coalition platform in Indonesia, point the way forward, including through the following recommendations and reflections:\par \par \uc2 First, focus safety net programs more clearly on producing, processing and consuming nutritious food in environmentally sustainable ways.Indonesia is a leader in safety net design, including shock responsive safety nets,and now is the time to show the rest of the world how safety nets can also be catalysts for food systemtransformation and resilience.\par \par \uc2 Simultaneously, it is necessary to mainstream the principle of a healthy diet and to invest in promotive and preventive actions to improve nutrition knowledge and practice through innovative social and behavior change communication strategies.\par \par \uc2 Second, Indonesian farmers have been negatively affected by the pandemic and the downturn, while at the same time, immensely creative in creating new business models thatconvey food to urban populations through digitally enabled short supply chains and local loops and linkages.\par \par \uc2 The government could increase its support of smallholder farmers to produce healthier and more sustainable food for the population (WFP, 2021) and to get it to market with less loss and waste, reducing costs and environmental losses. Procurement \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , research and developmentspending, real-time data and improved infrastructure could all greatly help build resilience, reduce costs and deliver better outcomes for people and the planet.\par \par \uc2 Third, actions under the first two points should not come at the expense of efforts to protect and restore Indonesia's remarkable and unique ecosystems. We believe there should be no trade-off between producing the food needed for the population and enabling the protection and restoration of critical forests and ecosystems. In fact, realizing the synergies between the two is essential for meeting Indonesia's ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and Agricultural, Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) sector plans for 2030.\par \par \uc2 We trust that decisionmakers across the governmentcan support this synergistic approach, including in the context of current decisions about the review of concession licenses.\par \par \uc2 Fourth, we welcome the growing attention to environmental and social governance (ESG) standards as increasingly important signposts for purposeful investment, but we note that ESG standards are silent on health and nutrition. Efforts to build these dimensions into ESG metrics by the True Value of Food Initiative and the Nutritious Food Financing Facility from the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition are helpful here. Here is another area where big payoffs to an integrated multisectoral approach can be found.\par \par \uc2 Fifth, at the global level, we encourage the G20 forum to develop a tangible proposal to address the huge \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  financing gaps in many middle and low-income countries. Furthermore, the forum needs to come up with incentives to intensify the participation of the global financial sector in food systems transformation.\par \par \uc2 Investment vehicles such as the &Green Fund are financing commercial projects in Brazil, Colombia and Indonesia, demonstrating the value and potential of a blended finance approach to transform the FOLU sector.\par \par \uc2 &Green (backed by European government donors, development finance and large corporates) has invested more than US$50 million in the past two years into the agriculture sector in Indonesia alone, supporting sustainable deforestation-free and inclusive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth. &Green's pipeline in Indonesia alone suggests there is significant scope for further blended finance investment and other actors, such as international impact investors, the Indonesian Investment Authority (INA), regional multilaterals and others, noting a growing number of global banks and institutional investorsshould also look to engage in the sector.\par \par \uc2 In summary, Indonesia could lead and be a model for the transformation of food systems at home and globally, delivering improved human, as well as planetary health at the same time. We believe there is a better way, and Indonesia is well placed to develop and implement it.\par \par \uc2 ____________________\par \par \uc2 Felia Salim is a member of the board of directors of Indonesia Eximbank, the Green Fund and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).

\par\par \b \uc2 Indonesia recovery still needs helping hand: \uc2 IMF\b0\par\par\uc2 Dzulfiqar Fathur Rahman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 851 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia may need to keep providing some \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  support until the country's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic firms up, while gradually unwinding emergency \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  to maintain stability and tackle downside risks, according to the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 IMF\uc2  forecast in its January outlook that Indonesia's Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by 5.6 percent this year and 6 percent next year.\par \par \uc2 Those growth forecasts, which mark downward revisions from figures stated in the \uc2 IMF\uc2 's previous report for Indonesia, are based on the assumption of continued \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  support in addition to favorable commodity prices, an ongoing vaccination campaign and the absence of severe mobility restrictions.\par \par \uc2 The government's effort to accommodate elevated \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  needs for health care and social protection while pursuing \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation by phasing out some emergency \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  was "appropriate," said Cheng Hoon Lim, the Indonesian mission chief at the Asia-Pacific department of the \uc2 IMF\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "With the recovery underway, gradually restoring the central tenets of the prepandemic macroeconomic \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  frameworks will reinforce Indonesia's strong \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  track record," Lim was quoted in a press release as saying on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 However, the \uc2 IMF\uc2  team noted in a statement on its latest report for Indonesia that, "if severe downside risks--such as a slower recovery or a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 infections and related containment measures--were to materialize, longer-lasting pandemic support could become necessary."\par \par \uc2 The government has reduced COVID-19 \b \highlight22\uc2 stimulus spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  for this year to Rp 455.6 trillion (US$31.6 billion), down 38.8 percent from last year's \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 , limiting the allocation to just three purposes, namely health care, social protection and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery, down from five purposes last year.\par \par \uc2 The government is phasing out \b \highlight22\uc2 stimulus spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  as it seeks to gradually bring the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  down to its normal cap at 3 percent of the GDP in 2023.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  was estimated at 4.65 percent of the GDP, Finance Ministry data show.\par \par \uc2 This was lower than an initial projection of 5.7 percent of GDP, as the government pocketed more revenue than expected.\par \par \uc2 Lim said the better-than-expected \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  outcome in 2021 was expected to lessen the trade-off between phasing out emergency \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  and providing adequate macroeconomic support.\par \par \uc2 The government has estimated this year's \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  at 4.85 percent of GDP, which is less optimistic than the \uc2 IMF\uc2 's 4 percent projection.\par \par \uc2 "Pandemic measures and the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery [program] that were effective in 2021 and were strengthened by the focus on job creation, health care and social protection in 2022, are important factors," Febrio Kacaribu, the head of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency (BKF), was quoted in a press release as saying on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The Job Creation Law and Harmonized \b \highlight22\uc2 Tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  Law are expected to spur investment and address the government's low-revenue problem, according to the \uc2 IMF\uc2 . However, it recommends that the government complement this with broader reforms, including in energy \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2 , education and infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Muted inflation in Indonesia has allowed \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 to support the recovery through accommodative policies, according to Lim. But inflation is forecast to gradually rise this year and return to the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 's target range, in part because of rising food prices.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, the consumer price index (CPI) rose just 1.87 percent, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data show, which was below the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 's target range of 2 to 4 percent.\par \par \uc2 BI said it planned to keep its seven-day reverse repo rate (7DRRR) at a record-low 3.5 percent until there was a sign of an uptick in inflation.\par \par \uc2 "We will direct monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  toward stability, safeguarding inflation and exchange rate stability as global pressures pick up," BI Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  said on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "But for four other policies, [namely] macroprudential, payment system, market deepening, \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  inclusion and the green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as well as international \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , we will keep pushing for synergy with the government to support the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 IMF\uc2  believes Indonesia is in a strong position amid risks posed by the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2  scaling back its bond-buying program and hiking \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 If Indonesia faces capital outflows, assuming the Fed pursues the tightening in a disorderly manner, BI should let the exchange rate absorb the shock first and, if necessary, adjust monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  later, according to Lim.\par \par \uc2 The country's foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  stood at $144.9 billion as of December 2021, equivalent to eight months of imports or 7.8 months of imports and foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  debt servicing, BI data show.\par \par \uc2 Faisal Rachman, an economist at publicly listed \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2 , said while the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook was positive, the recovery path was not free from risks, including the rising inflation that hastened monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization worldwide and might limit capital inflow.\par \par \uc2 "The \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly related to the new variant, is another major risk that needs to be continuously kept in mind," Faisal said in an analysis released on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220127ei1s00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 2021 investments exceed target as new policies take shape\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 610 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 January 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Full-year investment in Indonesia exceeded the 2021 target of Rp 900 trillion (US$62.71 billion) as new policies were implemented, despite the challenges of the Delta-fueled second wave of COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 Investment Minister \uc2 Bahlil Lahadalia\uc2  said on Thursday that investments reached Rp 901.2 trillion, a tad higher than the full-year target set by President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo, and up 9 percent from the preceding year.\par \par \uc2 Of the total investments, 50.4 percent came from foreign direct investment (FDI) and the remaining 49.6 percent from domestic direct investment.\par \par \uc2 "This was not easy. We had to have an extraordinary strategy," Bahlil told reporters during a virtual press briefing.\par \par \uc2 The minister said that investments managed to exceed targets as a result of the implementation of the Job Creation Law, marked by a significant 10 percent annual increase in FDI, compared with the 8 percent annual increase seen in domestic investment.\par \par \uc2 The massive infrastructure drive during President Jokowi's first term also contributed to the 2021 achievement.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, the Investment Ministry managed to reduce the number of stalled projects to just 25 percent of all projects in the pipeline, worth Rp 708 trillion. The figure stood at 33 percent as of November last year. In 2022, the ministry aims to get all of them going.\par \par \uc2 Investments exceeded targets at a time when the Delta variant outbreak compelled the government to impose fresh \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity restrictions in July 2021, which is expected to mute full year gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\par \par \uc2 In terms of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sectors, most of the investment went to metals manufacturing at Rp 117.5 trillion, mainly from smelter-development projects as mandated under the 2020 Mining Law.\par \par \uc2 The sector was followed by property and industrial zones at Rp 117.4 trillion, transportation, warehousing and telecommunications at Rp 107.4 trillion, electricity, gas and water at Rp 81.6 trillion then mining at Rp 81.2 trillion.\par \par \uc2 In the list of Indonesia's five biggest foreign investors, Singapore held the top spot at $9.4 billion, a third of total FDI. Hong Kong was the second-largest foreign investor at $4.6 billion, followed by China, the United States and Japan.\par \par \uc2 "The US is interesting. For the last five years, it has never made it to the list, but last year it entered with $3.2 billion," Bahlil said, adding that the ministry was expecting even more US investment this year.\par \par \uc2 Higher target in 2022\par \par \uc2 This year, the President has set the investment target at Rp 1.2 quadrillion, a 30 percent increase from last year, which could be challenging as the realization has always fallen short by at least 15 percent for the past five years.\par \par \uc2 Bahlil noted that rising COVID-19 cases and an increase in political \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , in part due to the upcoming general elections in 2024, could affect investment realization in 2022.\par \par \uc2 "If political stability is not maintained well in 2022, it is plausible that the target could be hard to reach," he said.\par \par \uc2 The ministry is betting on the implementation of the jobs law, growing global demand for natural resources and the country's downstreaming plans to hit the latest investment target.\par \par \uc2 Some specific downstreaming projects expected to materialize this year include coal gasification factories, petrochemical refineries and LG's electric vehicle battery component factory.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, the ministry plans to place teams in certain countries to help foreign investors expedite investments plans, such as by accelerating construction schedules. Teams will be placed in the United Arab Emirates, China, South Korea, Japan, Europe and the US.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220128ei1t00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 IT is not a \u64257\'FB\'01nal and legally binding opinion yet. But, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 and the government are better to listen very carefully to this initial recommendation from the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  (IMF) team who just \u64257\'FB\'01nished virtual consultations with Jakarta, last week. One of the key points: \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  to exit from monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  \u64257\'FB\'01nancing by the end-2022 target date. Indeed, since 2020, BI has been \u64257\'FB\'01nancing the government\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  by purchasing government bonds directly.\par \par \uc2 What is so wrong with this \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that has drawn such attention from the IMF team? The story goes back to 2020. When the Covid 19 pandemic hit hard, the government\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  de\u64257\'FB\'01cit soared drastically. To \u64257\'FB\'01nance this de\u64257\'FB\'01cit, the government issued bonds to the market. Due to its sheer size, it was impossible for the market to absorb all that issuance. BI then was the white knight to the rescue, purchasing directly big chunks of the bonds from the government. In market lingo, BI bought it in the primary market.\par \par \uc2 BI and the government called this move a burden-sharing mechanism. To the market and multilateral \u64257\'FB\'01nancial institutions, such as the IMF, it is just a euphemism for debt monetization. In lay terms, BI simply \u8220\'20\'1Cprints money\u8221\'20\'1D and give them away to the government to make ends meet.\par \par \uc2 The market certainly dislikes this \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It is against the principles of prudent macroeconomics management. Debt monetization will erode BI's credibility as an independent \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The rupiah\u8217\'20\'19s credibility would be negatively a\u64256\'FB\'00ected, too. BI has passed the rubicon. No central banks should be involved in \u64257\'FB\'01scal policies, let alone directly \u64257\'FB\'01nancing the government\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  de\u64257\'FB\'01cit. This trespass could stimulate a biased opinion when the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  needs to formulate monetary policies, its main mandate. Thus, the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s independence is not only about being free from politicians' pressure when conducting its tasks.\par \par \uc2 When BI and the government agreed upon this burden-sharing mechanism in 2020, the market reaction was almost indi\u64256\'FB\'00erent. BI successfully assured the market that it is only a one-o\u64256\'FB\'00 action following the agreement between BI\u8217\'20\'19s Governor and the Minister of Finance. In 2020, BI directly bought Rp 473,4 trillion worth of government bonds.\par \par \uc2 It turned out it was not a one-o\u64256\'FB\'00 \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The agreement has been extended, already in the third volume now. The government has been addicted to ample and easy money infusion from the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In 2021, the government obtained Rp358 trillion from BI. This year, BI will inject another Rp225 trillion through government bonds purchase.\par \par \uc2 Unsurprisingly, the IMF\u8217\'20\'19s team noted this risky \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  during the annual consultation. They came to the recommendation that it must be stopped immediately. The easy money not only eroded the country\u8217\'20\'19s macroeconomics credibility, it has also been creating serious moral hazards, inducing the ruling politicians to make imprudent government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Why should they worry about taking frugal steps if they could get easy \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  money from BI for their own political bene\u64257\'FB\'01t? No one seems to care about its long-term consequences to Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One clear example of this reckless irresponsible \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  is the new capital project. Within months, the government and DPR have successfully conspired to pass the new law as the legal basis for this project that will cost the country the tune of hundreds of trillion rupiah. This year only, the government must put aside Rp45 trillion. Whether this grandiose new palace will help to recover the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  or to boost \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  health, it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t really matter.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, the world out there is changing rapidly. The plentiful and cheap liquidity era has come to an end. The \u64257\'FB\'01nancial markets will be engulfed in volatile \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . If the IMF\u8217\'20\'19s team recommendation only falls on deaf ears, Indonesia will have to pay serious and costly consequences.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/01/31/793527/793527_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220131ei1v00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

The most important aspect is that we do not have to be too quick (to draw conclusions) because inflation is still looming over us, and inflation will reduce the people"s purchasing power," Kuncoro noted during a \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  hearing meeting with the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2 " \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  Committee here on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Transmission of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant increases the level of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . However, the spread of this variant has, so far, been more controlled than the Delta variant, so the situation is expected to have little impact on the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic remain significant, as controlling COVID-19 is currently proving to have a positive impact on the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Hence, it is no longer a trade-off," Kuncoro remarked.\par \par \uc2 He also supports the government"s efforts to control COVID-19 while still allowing the opening of activities through the gradual implementation of community activity restrictions (PPKM).\par \par \uc2 With \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth of 3.51 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021, this growth is seen as starting to return to normal or to pre-pandemic levels.\par \par \uc2 Kuncoro affirmed that inflation concurrently should be controlled, so that it does not spike when \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  management policies are restored, for instance, the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  is limited to no more than three percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\par \par \uc2 "We can learn that controlling inflation is crucial.

\par\par \b \uc2 Familial taboo stories of children who cut off contact with their parents\b0\par\par\uc2 2,951 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 February 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Raka Ibrahim, Contributor, Denpasar\par \par \uc2 Pychita Julinanda's earliest memory was of her mother beating her. Julie, as she prefers to call herself, recalls that these waves of abuse would come at random. Perhaps her mother had just had a bad day at work, or an argument with a boyfriend. Most of the time, though, it was simply the result of Julie's childhood petulance. She was young, confused and stubborn, so she saw the back of her mother's hand.\par \par \uc2 "I would go to church every Sunday and pray for her to change," Julie said. "I was in elementary school. I don't think that's what children should pray about."\par \par \uc2 Now only 23 years old, her life story has taken many gloomy turns. But it has resulted in an outcome many Indonesians dread to even consider: In January 2020, Julie left home and has cut off all contact with her mother. She admits to having no clue where her mother is now and has no idea how she is doing. Reconciliation, she says, will not happen anytime soon. (Disclaimer: Julie has written for The Jakarta Post).\par \par \uc2 In a society that prides itself on its close parent-child relations and tight-knit communities, such a scenario remains rare. However, according to psychologist Sani Hermawan, these cases are becoming more common.\par \par \uc2 "Children might develop different values to their parents, but sometimes these two different ways of seeing the world can no longer coexist," Sani said. "Some children also see toxic patterns in their family and exit the door before their lives are negatively affected."\par \par \uc2 As these young people take stock of their lives and attempt to rebuild with whatever is left, their stories are left as cautionary tales.\par \par \uc2 A difficult childhood\par \par \uc2 Nyai, who refuses to divulge her full name, remembers a childhood of difficult realizations. When she was still in her third year of elementary school, her stepfather sexually abused her. Three years later, she found out her biological father had raped her mother and that she was born out of that assault.\par \par \uc2 It was a lot to take in for someone who was still a child. But for Nyai, this at least explained the lifetime of violence and cold treatment by her parents. Her erratic mother never truly healed from her own wounds and lived a life of frustrations and extramarital affairs.\par \par \uc2 "She was physically and emotionally abusive to all her children," the 24-year-old said. "I had to protect my younger siblings and be a big girl for myself from an early age."\par \par \uc2 Any attempt at confronting the state of affairs was met with ignorance at best, and hostility at worst. "When I was in high school, I confessed to my mother's extended family that my stepfather had abused me," she said. "They turned their backs on me and accused me of lying."\par \par \uc2 That moment of collective betrayal stayed with Nyai. "I no longer had any connection to my mother and stepfather or considered them as role models," she revealed.\par \par \uc2 That inertia has constricted Julie all her life. She was raised by a single mother -- her biological father had been "out of the picture" after an abusive marriage and a messy divorce -- and both had survived dire times. "There were times when she would be very nice and close to me," Julie said.\par \par \uc2 They gossiped, laughed and bonded over being two women forced to make it alone in a cold, harsh world. That was just one side of the coin, though. "Her attitude and treatment were very inconsistent," Julie said. "Something random would set her off, then she becomes abusive. I would go to school with bruises and lie to my teachers."\par \par \uc2 As she grew older, the abuse turned from physical to emotional. Her mother became "controlling", getting angry when she did not regularly report to her throughout the school day and accusing her of favoring her friends over her when she asked to hang out or join extracurricular activities.\par \par \uc2 "When I was in high school, she found out I was dating someone secretly and she took away my phone for months," Julie said. "It doesn't just take away my entire life and means of communicating with my friends. All my school information, homework notes and photos were there. The consequences were dire."\par \par \uc2 In contrast to Julie's emotionally explosive household, Farah -- who also refused to reveal her full name -- came from a family that repressed their feelings. "I was a very anxious child and when I started school I was afraid my parents would leave me behind," she said. "So they packed my bags in front of me while I cried and threatened to send me to an orphanage. I was six."\par \par \uc2 They also had "a lot of deaths in the family", which was shrugged off in typical fashion. "I wasn't allowed to cry," Farah recalled. "My Dad just said, 'That's not your mother, you can't cry.' So I never cried. I still haven't been able to for the longest time."\par \par \uc2 Those formative experiences created a pattern of unhealthy emotional implosion. "I still had a lot of those anxieties growing up and I couldn't say anything," Farah said. "I couldn't tell them why I was worried because I didn't know why. And instead of helping me through that, they just told me it's not a big deal."\par \par \uc2 Trigger for escape\par \par \uc2 As avenues of communication and basic trust crumbled, they began nursing thoughts of escape. Beyond that, though, was a more primal feeling: that home was no longer a safe place to be in. "The more I grew up, the more I felt like I needed to get out of the house," Nyai revealed. "I had a strong urge to stay away."\par \par \uc2 The early steps of adulthood at least provided some manner of release. Nyai went away to East Java for college, while Farah secured a scholarship to South Korea and later found work there. That time away from their families gave them much-needed breathing space and an opportunity to find themselves away from the constraints of home.\par \par \uc2 Julie, though, wasn't so lucky. She studied in the same city as her mother and found that despite her impending adulthood, nothing had really changed. "I became really frustrated," she said. "I felt like I was missing out on a lot of things people were supposed to discover at that age. I felt like I was living in a cage."\par \par \uc2 Everything finally set off in late 2017. Her mother caught her smoking, sent a broadcast message to all her friends demanding to know who "taught her to smoke" and left her with a black eye. "My whole life was crumbling in front of me," Julie said.\par \par \uc2 Something had to give. Soon enough, she made her mind up and left the house for good, cutting off all ties with her mother in the process. As she rode off into an \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  future, her only worldly possessions were some clothes, a laptop, one pair of shoes and Rp 1.2 million (US$83) in savings. She was afraid, scarred and broke, but at least she was free.\par \par \uc2 A thousand miles from home, Farah's own facade of freedom was crumbling. Her relationship with her parents had deteriorated steadily during her years in South Korea and worsened further when she moved to the United States with her partner.\par \par \uc2 "No matter what I did in life, it wasn't good enough because I chose to stay abroad and I wasn't pious," she says. Her life, as successful as it was, did not fit in with her parents' narrow worldview, so nothing she did was appreciated and acknowledged. "They didn't care about my development," Farah said. "They just wanted me to come back and follow their rules."\par \par \uc2 It seemed innocuous -- a lack of approval, a stereotype, perhaps, of the gruff Asian parent -- yet years of it ground Farah to powder. "I had achieved so much, made so much money and did so many cool things, and I couldn't be happy with myself," she said. "I didn't think I was good enough to be anything. I don't think I deserve basic happiness."\par \par \uc2 With her sleep pattern ruined and her mental health failing, she began abusing painkillers. Then she resigned from a high-pressure job, the pandemic rushed through America and she had to go through the complicated process of extending her stay in a foreign country.\par \par \uc2 Things piled up and she could no longer juggle the strain of rearranging her life with keeping up with her family's expectations. "I would have rather be alive and see them again rather than give up and die," Farah recalled. "I don't want to think about their opinion of my life. I just want to move forward and live."\par \par \uc2 She cut off contact with her parents and fought to regain her dignity.\par \par \uc2 Worst day of her life\par \par \uc2 Nyai thought she had managed to wrangle some form of independence from her parents after she graduated college. She returned to Jakarta, found work and lived alone. At some point during in 2017 she came out to her mother as queer, and was pleasantly surprised by her warm acceptance. Things were tenuous, she said, but there was at least a delicate balance.\par \par \uc2 Everything shattered on a dramatic day in September 2020. "My mother asked if she could send some food over, so I shared my address with her," Nyai said. What arrived, though, was the "worst day of her life."\par \par \uc2 An army of relatives and unknown men pounded her door and forcibly dragged Nyai and her partner -- a trans man -- out of their beds. They were beaten up, verbally abused and physically assaulted. "I was dragged from the fourth-floor staircase all the way downstairs by my own mother," Nyai recalled. "She clawed my arms. My arms and legs were blue. They pulled my hair out."\par \par \uc2 The horrifying ordeal did not end there. After a tense ride home, she was taken to a pesantren in a remote village in Central Java. For two days, she was subjected to conversion therapy. "They bathed me and prayed over me," she recalled. "There were my parents, my aunts and a lot of grown-ass people surrounding me, crying."\par \par \uc2 "They told me to affirm my belief in God and drink something they had supposedly prayed over. I didn't get any rest. They woke me up in the middle of the night and forced me to pray. They handed me a holy book and told me to hold it so I wouldn't be afraid."\par \par \uc2 She could not sleep, she could not eat and she was physically and mentally battered. Upon returning home, she found herself a prisoner. "They took away all means of communication," Nyai said. "I was kept in a room and forbidden to go out, except to the bathroom. They even delivered food directly to my door."\par \par \uc2 During this period, her mother made half-hearted attempts at reconciliation. "She cried and promised she would change, that she wouldn't be the kind of parent she used to be," Nyai said. "The next day, I found her slapping my youngest sister's face. She wasn't even eight years old."\par \par \uc2 Then, things reverted to the unsettling normal. "One night, she sat me down and said: 'I'm sick of taking care of you. You're too wild,'" Nyai said, mimicking her mother. "'We're going to send you off to a pesantren and take your youngest sister with you. You're both women, so teach her to be a pious woman.'"\par \par \uc2 After five days of confinement, she managed to sneak out a message to the outside world and escape with the help of friends. She's thrifty about the details, but only because she's still afraid of reprisals from her extended family. "I just want people to know that I'm out here," she said. "I survived."\par \par \uc2 A tenuous peace\par \par \uc2 Sadly, Farah said, separating from her parents was a good step for her. "I went to the gym, I met new people, I took time for myself," she recalled. "I could do it all without the pressure of thinking that I would disappoint them."\par \par \uc2 After her visa in the US was sorted out, she made up her mind to return to Indonesia and introduce her partner to her parents. "I wanted them to see that he's a good person," she said. "I told my brother I was coming back and he told my dad. My dad said, 'Then they should get married, so when they come into my house, they are husband and wife.'"\par \par \uc2 It was a tall order, but Farah complied. Their first stop after checking out of a mandatory quarantine period was to their family home in the suburbs, where a small wedding ceremony awaited. "I hadn't seen my parents for two years and hadn't spoken to them in a year," Farah said. "The first time we saw and spoke to each other again was on my wedding day."\par \par \uc2 Although it seemed a nightmare scenario, the process convinced Farah that their time away from each other had been beneficial. "They welcomed my husband to the family, they compromised with what I wanted in the wedding, and I saw that they treated my brothers differently," she said. "They just loved us for being there. We can talk to each other and tell them things we are worried about now. There are more feelings."\par \par \uc2 According to psychologist Sani Hermawan, in an ideal situation, the children eventually reach a compromise in values. "The relationship becomes more strategic," she says. "Maybe they don't see each other as often, it may become less personal, and there are set boundaries, but there's a middle ground of mutual comfort that exists."\par \par \uc2 For Farah, it was a case of both parties meeting each other halfway. "Parents should understand that their kids haven't lived as long as they have, so a lot of the things that may not seem big to them will scare their kids to death," she said. "You pushing us to be what you want is not going to work, because we're not 55 years old. Stop expecting us to be better than who we truly are right now."\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, she also had to take time to see things from her parent's perspective. "Maybe the way they expressed their love was different to what I needed," she reflected. "But it's not easy to have that grace. Personally, I needed time away from them to realize that."\par \par \uc2 For others, though, separation does not elicit change. After eight months on her own, a relative told Julie of a personal crisis her mother was facing and she was tempted to reconcile. They gradually rebuilt their relationship, and she moved back in with her mother after over a year in the doldrums.\par \par \uc2 "But she acted like nothing happened," Julie said. "She didn't apologize, so the atmosphere was tense. I still had to tiptoe around her. In December 2019, I told her I wanted to live on my own. She was angry, but I felt nothing had changed. I wanted my own space."\par \par \uc2 She rented an apartment with friends and went away for a week-long trip to West Java, working and researching for her undergraduate thesis. "It was hectic, so I couldn't call her all the time," Julie said. "She bombarded me. She was [angry], and I was sick of her sense of entitlement. So I decided to walk away, once and for all. After West Java, I simply never came home."\par \par \uc2 Her final separation left her in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  shambles. Most of her belongings -- including her passport and laptop charger -- were at home, and she had nothing but a few pieces of clothing, her phone, a laptop and one pair of shoes. Ironically, it was the very same pair of shoes she took on her first escape from home.\par \par \uc2 "I feel chronically empty," Julie said. Since her second escape, she has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and untreated attention \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and struggles to function. "Most of my nightmares involve my mother. I have so much anger inside of me. I can't think clearly, I'm dysfunctional. It's difficult to build the pieces back together."\par \par \uc2 Nyai also found herself struggling to rebuild her life. She found work in a company in Jakarta and continued her budding career as a model. But her security situation means she has a special provision in her contract that forbids her clients from revealing her location on the day of a photo shoot. "I don't open windows anymore," she says. "I still get scared when someone knocks on my door."\par \par \uc2 Nyai has no interest in reconciling with her family, although she hopes one day to regain her relationship with her younger siblings. She speaks with barely concealed anger about her mother and the hell she made her live through. "I hate my mom now," she says. "I don't have any emotional consciousness for her. I can no longer cry for her. Her family made me feel like a prisoner."\par \par \uc2 Living, at least for now, is a journey to regain what she lost. "I'm trying to carry on for the sake of life itself," Nyai says. "I want to live for my loved ones and my dreams. I want to heal and be better than my parents. But I will take this anger within me forever."\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220203ei2400003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Insight: Simplifying the complexity of Papuan conflict could prove fatal\b0\par\par\uc2 960 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 February 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Vidhyandika D Perkasa,\par \par \uc2 One set of actions alone cannot solve the crisis in Papua, whether it manifests itself in conflict or socioeconomic deprivation. There is a need to initiate intervention to overcome conflict and promote development and peace as one integrated action. This is the underlying meaning of nexus, defined as a series of connections linking two or more things, persons or events in the same way.\par \par \uc2 However, in such a case, the government tends to undermine the nexus necessary to solve the complexity of Papua. Ironically, the complexity of Papua could be made worse by means of simplification.\par \par \uc2 Despite its controversy, the government finally extended the implementation of Special Autonomy for another 19 years (2022-2041) through Law No. 2/2021. Through this, it is clear that \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development is seen as an ultimate panacea to solve the complexity of Papua. Articles in the new Special Autonomy Law mandate \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development and investment, besides regulating other essential issues such as Papuan political and cultural representation. It is basically "\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  determination" heavy, which emphasizes the development aspect of the nexus.\par \par \uc2 More funds will be transferred to increase education, health services and indigenous people's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  empowerment in Papua and West Papua, according to the new law. With these increased funds, attention will be directed to improved \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  services, improving the welfare of indigenous Papuan and infrastructure development. This law also regulates the regional expansion mechanism, which is again intended to enhance \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  services in Papua.\par \par \uc2 The developmental approach in Papua through Special Autonomy first enacted in 2001 confirmed the government's standing that the alarming issues in Papua, including conflict, is all about \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  (mal)-development that should be corrected. Thus, it is assumed that conflict will subside when \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development is achieved, and peace will be manifest.\par \par \uc2 This by no means simplifies the complexity of the issues in Papua. Despite serious efforts to promote development, there is minimal effort to develop mechanisms to de-escalate conflict and promote peace.\par \par \uc2 Conflict-resolution mechanisms are seemingly about restoring order by sending more troops to the country's easternmost territory with the ultimate mission of capturing members of armed criminal groups. There are, however, still no signs of a de-escalation of the conflict that has claimed lives among the security forces, armed criminal groups and civilians. Late last month three soldiers were killed in a gunfight in the highland regency of Puncak.\par \par \uc2 Without special attention to initiating programs to reduce conflict and promoting peace, the development element of the nexus is in jeopardy. In other words, Special Autonomy could lose its effectiveness if the causes of conflict remain unaddressed. Many studies have shown the connection between conflict and development and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth. The consequences of the conflict for development are profound.\par \par \uc2 Conflict hinders the achievement of most development goals. Conflict is thus development in reverse. Research has shown that many \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions (low income, slow growth and severe \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  downturns) correlate with the outbreak of conflict.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the relationship between conflict and human development can be conceptualized in the framework of a low human development-conflict trap. Papua ranks the lowest in Indonesia's Human Development Index (HDI). A low HDI is usually associated with political instability, as in the case of Papua.\par \par \uc2 Unresolved conflict in Papua will destroy human capital and physical infrastructure, lead to the displacement of skilled labor, a disruption of social order and weaker institutions and a rise in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and political \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  that could prompt investors to delay long-term investments. Conflicts also destroy education and health outcomes. In general, conflict in Papua could have a negative impact on the country's per capita gross domestic product, however small its contribution to the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With the underlying threat that conflict could bring to the implementation of Special Autonomy, the government should put a special effort into assessing how the prevalence and intensity of conflict has evolved over time in Papua. In this case, we are talking about the multidimensional aspect of conflict sparked by armed criminal groups and other actors.\par \par \uc2 The implementation of Special Autonomy itself bears the risk of conflict if it results in injustice or marginalization of indigenous Papuans, since conflict could be an outcome of improvement (e.g. benefiting non-indigenous Papuan) and not necessarily impoverishment.\par \par \uc2 Observation should also be made of the impact of conflict in Papua on development, productivity and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth both directly and indirectly through spillover effects. This assessment would also assist the monitoring and evaluation aspect of Special Autonomy later on, which is currently still challenged by the effort to promote good governance.\par \par \uc2 Conflict-resolution mechanisms are urgently needed in the conflict and peace nexus. Referring to a life-cycle model of conflict, sadly, we have only seen rising tension, confrontation, intermittent violence and sustained violence. There should be an effort to promote a cease-fire and agreement implementation, which is central to peace enforcement and peacekeeping, leading to decreasing tension and post-conflict operations. However difficult it is, we also need to bring the armed criminal groups into a dialogue and the mediation process.\par \par \uc2 In this case, we must also avoid treating peacemaking as something ceremonial and procedural. Peacemaking is a comprehensive range of short, medium and long-term actions that can prevent conflict and build, create and sustain peace. This includes efforts to combat racism and discrimination, investigate human rights violations, promote trauma healing for the victims, and stressing the importance of political recognition for indigenous Papuans.\par \par \uc2 With those attempts, the nexus linking conflict, development and peace will hopefully find its true meaning for the betterment of Papua.\par \par \uc2 __________________\par \par \uc2 A senior researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220207ei280000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan has said that the Indonesian government would continue to prepare various reforms of regulations to support investment and encourage \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  transformation in the country.\par \par \uc2 "The government will also continue to prepare attractive incentive schemes to support domestic and foreign investors," Pandjaitan said at the 2022 Mandiri Investment Forum here on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The Minister explained that, currently, the government has provided various incentives, ranging from \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  holidays, easing of licensing regulations, incentives for industrial estates, and prioritising the level of domestic component (TKDN) for government procurement in National Strategic Projects (PSN).\par \par \uc2 "In the future, we will continue to focus on implementing regulations to facilitate investment that can encourage Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  transformation. We hope that investors will not hesitate to contact me if they have problems investing in Indonesia," he added.\par \par \uc2 Pandjaitan said, amid the increasing cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant, that the Indonesian government remained vigilant and would continue to handle the pandemic, starting from accelerating vaccinations, enforcing health protocols, enforcing \uc2 3M\uc2  movement (wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding crowds), enforcing 3T (tracing, testing, treatment), and enforcing the use of PeduliLindungi applications in \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  places.\par \par \uc2 However, the Omicron variant is not the only \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  that will be faced in 2022. Climate change is also one of the main issues that must be a concern of the government, Pandjaitan stated.\par \par \uc2 In line with its focus on global warming and its commitment to the Paris Agreement, Indonesia will continue to ensure that investments in Indonesia must be sustainable and environmentally friendly.\par \par \uc2 "We want to ensure that incoming investments must be environmentally friendly," he said.\par \par \uc2 Pandjaitan also reviewed a number of government policies related to commitments to mitigate the impact of climate change, ranging from terminating coal-based steam power plants, using new and renewable energy (EBT), and implementing carbon \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2  to encourage the electric vehicle battery industry.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RST/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 09-02-2022 18:42:19\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220209ei290012x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 G20 Indonesia 2022: G20 agenda: Inclusive and collaborative\b0\par\par\uc2 897 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 February 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Mohammed Ali Berawi , Jakarta\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  is an intergovernmental forum for addressing issues on the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , financial stability, climate change mitigation and sustainable development. The collective collaboration from industrialized nations and nations with emerging economies plays an important role in ensuring the achievement of inclusive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development and sustainable development.\par \par \uc2 Managing cross-sectoral and transnational interests with coordinated aims, strategies and instruments is essential to developing more comprehensive solutions in executing the G20 agenda. The collaboration of actors in different sectors may stimulate processes of \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and organizational learning, leading to better \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  design and more efficient implementation.\par \par \uc2 Currently, Indonesia's G20 presidency focuses on three main areas: global health architecture, a sustainable energy transition and digital transformation. Indonesia highlights the importance of concrete and holistic actions among nations to stimulate \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and sustainable development across the globe.\par \par \uc2 Science and technological development play a significant role in achieving these three goals.\par \par \uc2 The first agenda item shows how the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, slowing down business activities, reducing production and increasing unemployment and income \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Less investment, job losses and disrupted national and global trade and supply chains have caused many governments collaborate and take necessary actions to enable a robust global recovery.\par \par \uc2 The responses to COVID-19 have also prompted a strong drive to reduce unequal access to, and quality of, \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  education and health facilities supported by government policies to increase the country's resilience.\par \par \uc2 These mitigating actions are required at the national and international levels.\par \par \uc2 Thus, strengthening knowledge sharing and collaboration among stakeholders in international contexts, such as the G20 forum, is needed to tackle the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 The responses of many scientists and technologists during this pandemic have successfully facilitated progress in many areas, such as effective vaccines to prevent further spreading of the pandemic and medical devices needed by many patients affected by COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 Global coordination and cooperation are required to mitigate the spread of the pandemic and diminish its impact on \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and social stability.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, this first agenda item highlights the importance of strengthening the post-COVID-19 global health architecture, including the need for inclusive vaccine development and distribution and mobilization of global health financing.\par \par \uc2 Regarding the second agenda item, the energy system is experiencing rapid transitions that have been triggered by the latest developments of science and technology, updated regulations, consumer preferences and growing global demand for affordable and clean energy.\par \par \uc2 Yet, many countries face different energy challenges in their pursuit of a low-carbon \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Utilization of renewable energy sources and energy system digitalization to create more intelligent and flexible energy systems is key to ensuring a smooth energy transition process.\par \par \uc2 A shift toward decentralized energy systems will ensure that everyone can have stable and affordable energy.\par \par \uc2 Mutual partnership to support climate action is required, recognizing the importance of a just transition to a low-carbon \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  enabling a fair and just energy transition for many countries.\par \par \uc2 The energy transition system will be efficient and effective if it provides proper energy \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  support and financial incentives.\par \par \uc2 For the third G20 agenda item, on digital transformation, we have seen how digital technologies have been used to improve projects, products and services in different industries and to add value. Digital technology is used to manage integrated product whole-life cycles and enhance efficient, reliable and sustainable business operations.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, in cities, development is now more sustainable in terms of providing \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resource sharing, autonomous mobility systems, zero-emissions industrial products, recycling materials and organic food in urban areas, to name a few.\par \par \uc2 We are also using technology to tackle global challenges, including pandemic-related health improvement and virtual activities.\par \par \uc2 Digital technologies have already played vital roles in maintaining a functioning society by enabling remote working, facilitating contactless business transactions and automating corporate processes during the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 They are helping to create the "new normal" by delivering innovative ways for almost any activity to be conducted with even more productive outcomes.\par \par \uc2 These technologies can be used as a driver for \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development during the crisis and in the post-pandemic recovery to enhance national resilience; they are crucial for ensuring social and commercial continuity in these \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  times.\par \par \uc2 The well-being of our future will depend on how well we can produce technologies that can improve our climate, health, social equity and stability.\par \par \uc2 Governments are therefore also required to continue any policies that support the digital transformation and enhancement of relevant skills in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to cope with the ongoing situation and to deliver full support to the creative industries ecosystem through digitalization, such as in digital literacy, access and infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Digital technologies will enable resilience in SMEs by giving them practical online tools and business platforms from internal production through to connecting with the market and their customers.\par \par \uc2 Digital transformation policies are essential for the creation of ecosystems for digital growth strategies. The ecosystems should be enhanced by supportive \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  design, adequate funding and program implementation.\par \par \uc2 The transformation policies must provide adequate technology infrastructure and facilitate skill development.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, collaboration and coordination between technological, financial and \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  developments are now required to build digital competency and infrastructure for the post-pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 _______________\par \par \uc2 A professor at the University of Indonesia's (UI) School of Engineering and cochair of Science20 (S20)\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220209ei2a00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Recovery amid  \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 536 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 February 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovered with growth of 3.69 percent in 2021 from a contraction of 2.07 percent in 2020. Though the growth was lower than the 4 percent target, the recovery trend is still encouraging because on a quarterly basis the 5.02 percent growth in the last quarter of 2021 exceeded the annual average \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  expansion before the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 This significant recovery can be attributed to the commodity boom and the government's correct \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  response to the health and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government's bold, comprehensive and well-coordinated \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  measures to protect lives and livelihoods from the impact of the pandemic has succeeded in reducing both absolute poverty, open unemployment and the Gini ratio, a global index measuring inequality.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  was controlled at 4.65 percent in 2021, down from almost 6 percent in 2020. This trend has led to great optimism that the government is on the right path toward a strong recovery and smooth transition back to the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  ceiling of 3 percent in 2023 as required by Law No.2/2020. The government set the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  target this year as low as 4 percent.\par \par \uc2 The overarching reforms, as stipulated in the 2021 Harmonized \b \highlight22\uc2 Tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  Law, is expected to boost \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenues as the law raises rates and expands the coverage of value added \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  and introduces a 35 percent income \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  for the richest families. The second-round \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  amnesty offered in the new law will also bring about a significant one-off rise in income \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenues and expand the \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  base.\par \par \uc2 But despite the seemingly positive outlook of state revenues this year, a deeper look into the composition of the state revenues last year revealed the risk of too heavy dependence on commodities, notably minerals, oil and gas and palm oil. In fact, data over the last decade showed that state \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenues reached their annual target only when the commodity market boomed. The Finance Ministry has achieved and, in several cases, exceeded targets for \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2 , customs and excise, and nontax revenues mostly because of the commodity boom.\par \par \uc2 The quality of growth in terms of employment is also discouraging because the highest sectoral contributors to gross domestic product -- manufacturing industry, trade, mining, construction and agriculture -- still grew at below the average pre-pandemic rate. Moreover, the pandemic has yet to be gotten under control.\par \par \uc2 This trend requires the government to launch more concerted efforts to reinvigorate new investment in labor-intensive and higher value-added manufacturing industries. But new investors are likely to wait until the revision of the 2020 Job Creation Law, as ordered by the Constitutional Court, and the country will continue to muddle through with a maximum growth of 5 percent.\par \par \uc2 Unless the revision is made this year, \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  will continue to loom over new investments as the law, which has been welcomed by investors as the most comprehensive and boldest reform so far, will remain in limbo. In 2023 most members of the Cabinet and politicians will be preoccupied with political grandstanding campaigns as they gear up for the Feb. 14, 2024 presidential and general elections.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220210ei2b0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Keeping  \highlight22\uc2 economic \highlight\uc2  resilience amid global  \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 1,031 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 February 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Kiki Verico , Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Statistics Indonesia (BPS) reported last week that the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  grew by 3.69 percent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2021, from a contraction of 2.07 percent in 2020, and strongly recovered by 5.02 percent on a quarterly basis. Meanwhile, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 announced that inflation in 2021 rose to 1.87 percent from 1.68 percent in 2020.\par \par \uc2 The combination of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and the inflation rate pattern is validation that Indonesia's aggregate supply has recovered, and demand has entered the optimism zone. This pattern shows that in 2021, Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  returned to productivity as growth was above the inflation rate. Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  productivity depends on how the country contains the pandemic shock.\par \par \uc2 The question now is how to maintain the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience? This question is rooted in the essential sources of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 Almost 2,500 years ago, the great ancient Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle explained the importance of knowledge, value and passion. In my own words, they areintelligencefor knowledge,moralityfor value andmentalityfor passion.\par \par \uc2 Every person needs these elements together to enhance their competitiveness. Without one, human competitiveness will always remain below its potential. The higher a population's competitiveness, the higher the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth of its country.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the government's fundamental role is to ensurethe quality of human knowledge based on education and the health system, strengthening the quality of institutions through ongoing reforms and stimulating the productivity of the people through market mechanisms.\par \par \uc2 Over the last 100 years, modern economists have mathematically formulated the importance of human capital, integrity and productivity, while as Plato explained, knowledge indicates the quality of human capital, value represents institutional integrity and passion promotes productivity.\par \par \uc2 Both the philosophical and mathematical methods reveal the essential sources of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth. Both combinations prove that robust \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is dependent on three factors, which are human capital, institutions and productivity. These three factors work in-between market mechanisms and government intervention. We must manage the balance between the two.\par \par \uc2 Nothing in life is perfect. All we have is our best, and we need to work hard to keep what we have on an ideal path. The market mechanisms we have are not perfect, but are the bestthe \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  has produced. Government intervention exists to complete market mechanisms.\par \par \uc2 Every time market mechanisms collapse, government intervention must come to the forefront and work harder. In \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  terminology, this is known as the countercyclical approach, where the annual \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  increases to face \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  contraction and market stagnancy. If market mechanisms return to normal, the countercyclical \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can be tapered.\par \par \uc2 Law No. 2/2020 on state financialpolicy and system stability for COVID-19 handling projects that the countercyclical \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will end in 2022, and in 2023 the annual \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  will return to the global standard measurement of below 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\par \par \uc2 If the market mechanisms begin to work as usual and people start to live with COVID-19 as an endemic virus, the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will become normal. Indonesia can refocus on its three essential \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth sources. This will involve endogenous factors, covering education and health, with exogenous factors including physical and digital infrastructure, technological development and structural reforms.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, global health and economies have remained \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  with the new variant of Omicron starting to increase the number of infections worldwide in late 2021 to early 2022, following the Delta variant in mid-2021. Both global health and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery patterns are asymmetric within countries.\par \par \uc2 This phenomenon is part of the so-called prolonged scarring effect of the global pandemic, as the world also witnessed around 100 years ago with the 1918 influenza. Governments around the globe must work together to guarantee the game-changer in the convergent recovery: equal vaccination access for all countries. Nobody wins until everyone gets to the finish line.\par \par \uc2 As no product is produced by one country because of global supply chains, the health and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery for all countries are vital. Convergent shifting from pandemic to endemic must happen at the same time for all countries, and this indeed takes time. Success relies on patience and persistence while riding the wave of the pandemic's effects.\par \par \uc2 In 2022, the most significant challenges lie in production and logistic disruption of aggregate supply. Global production networks face both energy crises and production disruption due to uneven recovery patterns from the pandemic. These supply shocks increase inflation worldwide through the increasing imported inflation, including in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 However, in 2021, the Indonesian inflation rate remained stable and below its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth. This shows that the increasing money supply in Indonesia can be attributed more to the increase of output than that of price. This pattern shows good practice in Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The next challenge is in Indonesia's "Phillips curve", where \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth increases labor force absorption; hence the inverse relation between open unemployment and the inflation rate exists.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  has returned to positive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and it is time to aim for quality growth, with the core focus on unemployment and formal activities. Both are the cornerstones of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  transformation. The combination of declining open unemployment and inclining formal activities is the catalyst for escaping \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  contraction.\par \par \uc2 A complete set of macroeconomic achievements in 2021 for Indonesia are good starting indicators, and in 2022 Indonesia needs to ride the wave of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil correctly. To ride this wave, the country needs a bigger international reserve buffer, which Indonesia has strengthened from US$129.2 billion in 2019 to $135.9 billion in 2020 and $144.9 billion in 2021. Indonesia needs to keep up its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience throughout the rest of the pandemic.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth rooted in productivity ideally generates jobs locally and international \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  globally. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes endemic this year, from 2022 onward, Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth will increase even more, and possibly above the pre-pandemic average rates.\par \par \uc2 ________________\par \par \uc2 An adviser on industry and international trade to the finance minister and senior lecturer of international economics at the University of Indonesia.

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 THE dispute over land belonging to \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  in Jalan Pemuda, East Jakarta, is an example of the government\u8217\'20\'19s lack of seriousness in managing state assets.\par \par \uc2 The land owned by \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  there has faced two lawsuits. The first was brought by a person claiming to be an heir, and ended with \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  losing in 2003 at the Supreme Court. In that case, the Supreme Court asked the state oil company to pay compensation.\par \par \uc2 The second lawsuit came in 2014 from another heir at the East Jakarta Court. In this case, the court found for the plaintiff and seized Rp244 billion from \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s account at the Veteran branch of BRI as compensation. \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s attorneys allege there was falsification of documents in this case. They have reported this to the Greater Jakarta police.\par \par \uc2 As well as the land in Jalan Pemuda, there are many other government assets that could soon disappear. In Makassar, South Sulawesi, seven state assets are now the subject of disputes with a number of \u8216\'20\'18heirs\u8217\'20\'19. Spread around a number of locations, these plots are being used for PLN electrical substations, ports and toll roads. In West Nusa Tenggara, land belonging to Pengembangan Pariwisata Indonesia, which manages the Mandalika Special \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Park, is also the subject of a lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 There are strong suspicions that the land mafia is behind the plundering of these state assets. The National Land Agency (BPN) has identified a group acting in major cities and in areas experiencing growth due to very high land prices. They have a network covering the police, the Attorney General\u8217\'20\'19s Office and the BPN. If action is not taken, more and more state land will disappear.\par \par \uc2 This is where the government is being weak. The management of state-owned enterprises and other institutions often does not have valid and definitive land deeds. This is because they were not cautious enough when buying the land from the original owners. It is also possible that these purchases went ahead using illegal processes in order to benefit a small number of individuals. Now, in the face of legal problems, the government is \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  what to do.\par \par \uc2 The State Asset Management Agency, which is tasked with inventorying state assets for commercialization, has discovered that many assets are not yet \u8216\'20\'18free and clear\u8217\'20\'19 because, among other reasons, they are still controlled by a third party. The report of the audit carried out by the Supreme Audit Agency on the 2020 central government financial report also concluded that the management of assets was still not satisfactory.\par \par \uc2 The government must be serious about improving the management of the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  of state assets, especially land. The legality of land must be guaranteed through an examination of all of the ownership documents. The BPN, which is now busy trying to certify land, must play a major role in ensuring that the assets of ministries, institutions and state-owned enterprises are registered and have deeds. The government also needs to set up a competent legal team to respond to legal disputes so that the state does not easily lose assets.\par \par \uc2 The land mafia network must be eradicated. The police, the Attorney General\u8217\'20\'19s Office, Supreme Court officials and BPN staff members who involve in this land robbers\u8217\'20\'19 must face action.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/02/14/794515/794515_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220214ei2e00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 G20 Indonesia 2022: Indonesia's G20 presidency amid rising trade tensions\b0\par\par\uc2 1,192 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 February 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Lili Yan Ing , Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  presidency in 2022 is crucial for the global recovery from the health and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crises wrought by COVID-19. With rising protectionism and increasing trade tensions around the world, how prepared is Indonesia to address these issues?\par \par \uc2 In February 2020, the United States and China signed the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Trade Agreement -- the so called "Phase One" trade deal -- which many have predicted will only create further trade diversions in global trade. And indeed, the US-China trade (now including technology) tensions have been escalating instead of decreasing, putting pressure on smaller economies to choose between the two global powers.\par \par \uc2 Even after the agreement was signed, Beijing's dual circulation plan promotes self-reliance, indigenous innovation and settling more trade deals in renminbi. At the same time, the US strategy is equally (or more so) escalating tensions with its policies of realigning supply chains by "friend-shoring", accompanied by policies mandating that key technologies must be produced at home or by designated US allies. The largest and most innovative US electric vehicle company has even started controlling its own supply chains.\par \par \uc2 So, what solutions can Indonesia offer during its G20 presidency?\par \par \uc2 Let's start by reviewing Indonesia's foreign trade \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , where it stands, and what it can offer the G20. East Asia, including Southeast Asian countries grouped as ASEAN (including Indonesia), has been achieving high \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth based on trade and investment. ASEAN has been very active in promoting trade and investment as well as forming trade agreements to facilitate this, including the \uc2 ASEAN Free Trade Area\uc2  (A FTA) in 1992 and the ASEAN+1 FTAs with its main trading partners, which was mostly concluded in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Recently, ASEAN and its five main trading partners concluded the \uc2 Regional Comprehensive \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Partnership\uc2  (RCEP). The RCEP came into effect on Jan. 1 as it has already reached the quorum with ratification by 11 member countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, and all non-ASEAN signatories (Australia, China, Japan, Korea and New Zealand). Indonesia has not ratified the agreement yet.\par \par \uc2 The RCEP is the largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  bloc in the world. Even without India, in 2021, the countries in the RCEP accounted for 31 percent of the world's population, 31 percent of global gross domestic product, 27 percent of trade and 33 percent of foreign direct investment (FDI).\par \par \uc2 By comparison, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (or TPP) without the US (now called the CPTPP) represents only 7 percent of the world's population, 13 percent of global gross domestic product, 15 percent of trade, and 20 percent of FDI.\par \par \uc2 While ASEAN joins the RCEP, will ASEAN (including Indonesia) join the CPTPP? Most ASEAN countries are less likely to join the CPTPP in the absence of the US due to at least three reasons.\par \par \uc2 First, economics: ASEAN countries would face high adjustment costs with relatively smaller benefits compared to joining the RCEP.\par \par \uc2 Second, domestic political \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 : The CPTPP contains more ambitious provisions that require broader, deeper and shorter time for adoption into domestic laws including state-owned enterprises, intellectual property rights, competition \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and labor and environmental standards.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, the benefit of the RCEP is that even though it doesn't call for liberalization at the same level, scope or depth of commitment as the CTPP, its impacts on the economies of member countries, and indeed on the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , will be massive. At the same time, the RCEP will incentivize supply chains in the region while also being sensitive to political conditions and levels of development in member countries.\par \par \uc2 Neither the US nor China listens to trade economists as they keep creating trade diversions by any means. But at least they have learned that protectionism does not work.\par \par \uc2 So, ASEAN's current top priorities are the implementation of the RCEP and the ASEAN-EU trade agreement (either bilaterally or as a unified ASEAN).\par \par \uc2 Does this mean that ASEAN (Indonesia) stands for China over the US? Of course not. ASEAN will retain is neutrality and stand for neither of them. At this moment, neither the US nor China listens to trade economists as they keep creating trade diversions by any means. But at least they have learned that protectionism does not work.\par \par \uc2 When the US decided to increase \b \highlight22\uc2 tariff\b0 \highlight\uc2  rates on US$350 billion worth of imports from China, it was aiming to block imports from China. But less than two years later, the results are the other way around. In 2021, US exports to China were $179 billion and imports from China $576 billion resulting in a $397 billion trade \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  in goods with China - the largest in 30 years.\par \par \uc2 The same result applied to Chinese's efforts to ban Australia's exports. China implicitly banned all imports from Australia, except iron ore, which is needed for China's steel industry. China tried to source inputs from other countries thus creating trade diversions.\par \par \uc2 However, while Australia lost $4.4 billion in its trade with China, it has been able to access new markets worth $4 billion. Eventually, trade coercion China created vis-?-vis Australia resulted in increased iron ore prices, resulting in an increase of 10 percent of Australia's total exports in 2021.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, prolonged US-China trade and technology tensions will raise \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  that will be translated into costs for everyone, most of all, for the American and Chinese people. The US-China tensions further intensify the urgency of strengthening the rules-based multilateral trading system.\par \par \uc2 To address these issues, Indonesia's G20 chairmanship should pursue trade and investment (Indonesia is now proposing trade, investment and industry) by emphasizing the following:\par \par \uc2 First, Indonesia should obtain G20 commitments to eliminate unnecessary regulations and customs clearances while at the same time increasing surveillance on specific health supplies, medicines and medical appliances. The pandemic has taught us how health and \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  are strongly connected.\par \par \uc2 Second, G20 countries should commit to strengthening the multilateral trading system to serve its three main functions: Trade rules, negotiations and dispute settlement. These need to be separate commitments -- not tied to one another. One of the key functions of the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  is the dispute settlement mechanism; it is a must to ensure that it is well functioning.\par \par \uc2 Third, Indonesia should encourage G20 members to implement the Doha Development Agenda agreed back in 2001. At the same time, in response to new issues in trade, Indonesia can encourage members to pursue an open plurilateral agreement mechanism to move forward in the negotiation on difficult issues in the \uc2 WTO\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In conclusion, while useful, forming mega-FTAs like the RCEP and the CPTPP with pro-trade middle powers is a stopgap solution, not a substitute for a well-functioning multilateral trading system. If the global powers keep exercising their powers, the markets and customers can too.\par \par \uc2 We can learn from the renewable energy market on how people-driven power can stir the whole \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and political landscape.\par \par \uc2 ________________\par \par \uc2 Lead adviser for the Southeast Asia Region at the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia\uc2  (ERIA).

Like previous variants of concern, Omicron affected countries at different times.\par \par \uc2 The capacity gap to cope with the pandemic, including the rollout of vaccines across countries, is a major factor causing uneven recovery. These, she added, would shape the future global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  landscape.\par \par \uc2 She also said that Indonesia hosted the G20 Presidency at a time full of challenges. On the one hand, G20 countries must follow through on commitments to address global health challenges to help countries manage the impact of Omicron and other variants that may emerge. On the other hand, G20 countries will have to manage other short-term risks.\par \par \uc2 Managing the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and financial impact of the pandemic and increasing equitable access to vaccines remain priorities for expanding and strengthening the global recovery. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd to make sure that we recover together and recover stronger,\u8221\'20\'1D said Sri Mulyani.\par \par \uc2 Read: Sri Mulyani: \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Recovers Faster During Pandemic than in '98 Crisis\par \par \uc2 MUHAMMAD HENDARTYO\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/02/17/id_1088745/1088745_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020220217ei2h0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia"s balance of payments (BOP) in 2021 was quite resilient amid global pressure caused by the escalation of the pandemic and the US Fed\u8217\'20\'19s tapering, according to the Finance Ministry"s \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency (BKF).\par \par \uc2 "It is quite a crucial achievement since BOP is one of the pillars of our national macroeconomic stability," BKF Head Febrio Kacaribu said in a statement issued here on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 The BOP showed a positive performance in 2021 by recording a surplus of US$13.5 billion or 1.13 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), which was substantially higher than the surplus of US$2.6 billion recorded in 2020, he noted.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, Indonesia"s current account balance recorded a surplus of US$3.3 billion or 0.3 percent of the GDP compared to a \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of US$4.4 billion in 2020, he said.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the capital and financial account balance surplus rose to US$11.7 billion, or 1 percent of the GDP, in 2021 from US$7.9 billion in 2020, the BKF head.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, direct investment surplus increased to US$16.49 billion in 2021 from US$14.14 billion in 2020 thanks to the domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which started to recover, he said.\par \par \uc2 Structural and \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  reform to improve Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s investment climate -- such as the issuance of the \b \highlight22\uc2 Tax Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  Harmonization Law in October 2021 -- was able to retain investors" confidence for investing long term in the country, he added.\par \par \uc2 Hence, in the fourth quarter of 2021, there was an increase in the direct investment surplus, which reached US$3.4 billion, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The positive impact of the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  reform is expected to further strengthen the trust of foreign investors to invest in Indonesia," he added.\par \par \uc2 However, there is still high \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in global financial markets, in line with the tightening of monetary policies of developed countries, which are likely to affect investment in Indonesia, he said.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-UYU/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 20-02-2022 06:53:31\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220220ei2k00002\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 The Social Security Debate\b0\par\par\uc2 2,774 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 February 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 AT the end of last year, on December 16, Subiyanto attended a virtual meeting hosted by the ministry of justice and human rights. But the main presentation to be discussed that Thursday came from a representative from the manpower ministry, on the draft revision to Manpower Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  (Permenaker) No. 19/2015 on the procedure and requirements for disbursing old-age benefits (JHT).\par \par \uc2 After the presentation, Subiyanto, a labor representative for the National Social Security Council, asked a question. \u8220\'20\'1CHas this been discussed with the tripartite forum?\u8221\'20\'1D asked Subiyanto, who is also All-Indonesia Workers Union Confederation (KSPSI) Vice President IV overseeing wages and social security. He spoke to Tempo about the virtual meeting while he was in Tangerang, Banten, on Thursday, February 17.\par \par \uc2 During the meeting, Subiyanto cautioned that ministerial-level regulations must first be discussed with the tripartite forum formed by the President\u8212\'20\'14a forum made up of government, business, and labor representatives. According to Subiyanto, both Manpower Ministry\u8217\'20\'19s Chief of Legal Affairs Reni Mursidayanti, and Director of Worker Social Security Retna Pratiwi, answered his question in unison: yes, they had discussed the draft revision with the tripartite forum. \u8220\'20\'1CSo, I thought positively of the manpower ministry, that (the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 ) was already discussed with the tripartite forum,\u8221\'20\'1D Subiyanto said.\par \par \uc2 Recently, a new rule, Permenaker No. 2/2022 on the procedure and disbursement of JHT was issued. Manpower Minister Ida Fauziyah signed the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on February 2, and the ministry of justice and human rights passed the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  two days later.\par \par \uc2 BP Jamsostek participants fill out forms at the BP Jamsostek Menara Mulia branch office, Jakarta, June 2020. ]Tempo/Tony Hartawan\par \par \uc2 Two weeks after, labor protestors endlessly urged Minister Ida Fauziyah to cancel the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  revokes the old \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that workers who became unemployed\u8212\'20\'14both due to dismissal and resignation\u8212\'20\'14would be able to receive JHT benefits early. Now, JHT benefits, both for retired workers as well as those who have become unemployed, are paid when beneficiaries reach 56 years old.\par \par \uc2 The new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  also cancels a similar \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  created by the manpower ministry during Minister Hanif Dhakiri\u8217\'20\'19s tenure. Under the old \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , workers who become unemployed due to dismissal, resignation, or leaving Indonesia for good may withdraw their JHT funds in cash without having to wait until retirement age. The waiting period was only one month, without a minimum participation period.\par \par \uc2 When protests broke out, the manpower ministry used the same argument, making the \u8220\'20\'1Cdiscussion with the national tripartite forum\u8221\'20\'1D a trump card. On Thursday, February 17, the ministry tweeted that the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  was the result of the ideas of the workers body of the tripartite forum on November 18, 2021.\par \par \uc2 The manpower ministry\u8217\'20\'19s claim regarding the November 18, 2021 meeting with the tripartite forum spread and became a topic of conversation among labor circles. The gossip finally narrowed to a single question. \u8220\'20\'1CSo, labor representatives within the tripartite forum have approved the revision to Permenaker No. 19/2015?\u8221\'20\'1D said Muhammad Sidarta, Chairman of the West Java Metal, Electronic, and Machine Workers Union (FSPL EM), on Thursday, February 17, repeating the question asked by members of his union.\par \par \uc2 Sidarta, who is a member of the tripartite forum, became a laughingstock within his own organization. Sidarta confirmed that the manpower ministry did invite the tripartite forum\u8217\'20\'19s workers body to discuss the plan to revise the JHT \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but he denied that the forum produced ideas that became the basis for revising the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThe fact is, the meeting on November 18, 2021, only discussed ideas on how to return JHT to its philosophy as a retirement fund,\u8221\'20\'1D said Sidarta. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was a discussion with the workers body, so it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t fully developed. It needed a plenary session, like a plenary session at the parliament.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, February 17, Sidarta finally met with Minister Ida Fauziyah. The minister received FSP LEM representatives who had been protesting against her. Sidarta immediately spoke his mind. He admitted to being bullied by his own peers for supposedly approving Permenaker No. 2/2022 via the tripartite forum. \u8220\'20\'1CI object because the contents of Permenaker No. 2/2022 were not discussed in a plenary session with the tripartite forum\u8217\'20\'19s workers body,\u8221\'20\'1D said Sidarta.\par \par \uc2 According to Sidarta, Minister Ida did not respond to his objection. She, he said, only explained that now workers already have a replacement for JHT if they are laid off, which are the unemployment benefits (JKP).\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 MINISTER of Manpower Ida Fauziyah used a similar trick when criticism began to arrive from the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR). The ministry\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account shared her statement that the new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on pension fund was the aspiration of many stakeholders. The recommendation, among others, as the tweet explained, came from a hearing on September 28, 2021, between the ministry and DPR\u8217\'20\'19s Commission IX that deals with matters of health, manpower, and population.\par \par \uc2 During the hearing, Ida sent Indah Anggoro Putri, Director-General of Industrial Relations Development and Worker Social Security. Indah explained that JHT\u8217\'20\'19s philosophy had shifted from its original purpose as pension savings to emergency funds. Workers who are fired or have resigned can immediately withdraw their JHT.\par \par \uc2 Muhammad Sidarta, Chairman of the Federation of Metal, Electronic and Machinery Unions of West Java. Ministry of Manpower Instagram\par \par \uc2 Indah reported that her ministry was revising Manpower Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 19/2015, which is believed to be the cause behind JHT\u8217\'20\'19s shifting function. \u8220\'20\'1CWe return JHT to its philosophy as an old-age savings, as mandated by the National Social Security System Law,\u8221\'20\'1D Indah said then.\par \par \uc2 Law No. 40/2004 on the national social security system (SJSN) indeed never regulated JHT\u8217\'20\'19s disbursement for participants who have lost their jobs. It was Permenaker No. 19/2015 that regulated this, and the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  was issued during a pressing situation.\par \par \uc2 That year, the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  had slowed down as the market responded to the Federal Reserve\u8217\'20\'19s stricter monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the United States in 2013. The rupiah\u8217\'20\'19s value plummeted, impacting labor-intensive industries which relied on materials from overseas. Commodity prices also fell. As a result, workers were laid off everywhere.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the government had issued Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 46/2015 on the implementation of the JHT program. The \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  had been in waiting for 11 years as the implementing \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  for the SJSN Law. But this \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  states that JHT\u8217\'20\'19s total accumulated value cannot be disbursed until a worker has reached retirement age.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, the disbursement scheme for some JHT funds for workers who have participated for 10 years\u8212\'20\'14as regulated under the SJSN Law\u8212\'20\'14is also limited in terms of portion and uses. Participants can withdraw a maximum 30 percent of their JHT funds for home ownership, or at least 10 percent for other needs in line with retirement preparations.\par \par \uc2 The root of the problem was, the government had not yet ratified the \uc2 International Labour Organization (ILO) \uc2 International Labour Organization\uc2  (ILO) Social Security Convention, 1952 (No. 102), which requires a country to provide unemployment benefits for workers. Besides severance pay, JHT was the only social security program that could be used at the time. Protest broke out everywhere. With workers fighting the move, the government finally relented and held a series of meetings with labor unions.\par \par \uc2 Manpower Minister Ida Fauziyah (right) in a dialogue with union leaders regarding the Manpower Minister \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 2/2022 concerning pensions, in Jakarta, February 17. kemnaker.go.id\par \par \uc2 Subiyanto, a labor representative for the National Social Security Council (DJSN), attended these meetings, which were held in mid-2015. As he recalled, the agreement made at the time was to immediately revise Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 46/2015. Meanwhile, the requirements for disbursing JHT funds would be returned to those under Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 14/1993. The old \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  follows Law No. 93/1992 on worker social security. Essentially, a worker who is unemployed before retirement age would be able to withdraw JHT funds if they have participated at least for five years.\par \par \uc2 But the new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 60/2015, only created a new problem. Under the rule, President Joko Widodo delegates the procedure and requirements for disbursing JHT to the minister of manpower.\par \par \uc2 This new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  was the basis for then-Minister of Manpower Hanif Dhakiri to issue Permenaker No. 19/2015. \u8220\'20\'1CAt the time, the government issued a special \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . While waiting for the JKP, JHT was able to be withdrawn by workers who have either been laid off or have resigned,\u8221\'20\'1D said Indra Budi Sumantoro, an expert member at the DJSN, on February 15. \u8220\'20\'1CAlthough in practice, more workers who have resigned have been withdrawing their JHT.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 MAJOR PROGRAM\u8217\'20\'19S \b \highlight22\uc2 UNCERTAIN\b0 \highlight\uc2  FATE\par \par \uc2 FOR years, the old-age benefits (JHT) program has been the largest source of revenue for the worker social security agency, BP Jamsostek. Monthly premiums paid by JHT participants have also been the primary contributor to BP Jamsostek\u8217\'20\'19s investment funds, in the amount of trillions of rupiah, most of which are placed in government bonds to support government \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Ironically, the management of how the JHT should benefit its worker customers has been chaotic.\par \par \uc2 Tempo contacted Hanif Dhakiri on Wednesday, February 16, to ask the story behind Permenaker No. 19/2015. But the National Awakening Party (PKB) politician was reluctant to answer.\par \par \uc2 Delegating the mechanism to the minister instead resulted in new issues. Besides not having a legal basis, JHT\u8217\'20\'19s disbursement scheme for unemployed participants has caused it to be seen as an emergency fund for workers who have been fired or have resigned. Subiyanto explained that the DJSN has been recommending the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  be revised since 2017.\par \par \uc2 The finance ministry was also dismayed. The office led by Sri Mulyani Indrawati discussed the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  more in depth as it directly related to the optimization of manpower social security asset management. When discussing the plan to revise Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 55/2015 on the management of manpower social security assets, Subiyanto said the finance ministry complained about the JHT funds being able to be withdrawn in the short term.\par \par \uc2 JHT\u8217\'20\'19s disbursement scheme for unemployed participants was being accused of the reason behind the less-than-optimal management of premium of workers social security program BP Jamsostek. Because the funds must be able to be withdrawn quickly once they are claimed, JHT investments tend to be placed in low interest, short-term instruments, such as deposits, although there are other instruments with higher interests, including government bonds (SBN) with lower risk as they are guaranteed by the state.\par \par \uc2 The problem came to a head when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. Many workers were laid off or resigned. The number of BP Jamsostek claims skyrocketed.\par \par \uc2 A BP Jamsostek service official serves a participant at the BP Jamsostek Menara Mulia branch office in Jakarta, June 2020. Tempo/Tony Hartawan\par \par \uc2 In 2020, JHT claims reached 2.5 million, or an increase of 13 percent compared to the previous year. As many as 75.70 percent of these claims were made by workers who had resigned. Meanwhile, 19.15 percent of the claims were made by workers who were laid off. Only 2.1 percent were claimed by those who were really entering retirement. The majority of claimants were also in the productive age group of 20 to 50 years old.\par \par \uc2 To BP Jamsostek Chief executive officer (CEO) Anggoro Eko Cahyo, the data show that there is potential that the JHT program may not be enjoyed by workers in their old age, which means that its use needs to be returned to its initial purpose. \u8220\'20\'1CThe good news is, the average monthly JHT claim has decreased in 2021,\u8221\'20\'1D Anggoro said in a hearing with DPR\u8217\'20\'19s Commission IX on November 15, 2021.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 AFTER years of standstill, efforts to revise Permenaker No. 19/2015 finally found some light when the Job Creation Law revised parts of the National Social Security System Law and Law No. 24/2011 on the social security agency (BPJS). A new program was introduced: the unemployment benefits or JKP.\par \par \uc2 The JKP program was able to come into effect on February 2, as the government had already issued its implementing regulations in February and July 2021. JKP\u8217\'20\'19s premium amounts to 0.46 percent of a monthly salary\u8212\'20\'14with a maximum first wage set at Rp5 million. The government shoulders 0.22 percent, while the remaining 0.24 percent is taken from the work accident insurance as well as life insurance, which are taken from worker\u8217\'20\'19s salary.\par \par \uc2 Workers who have been laid off can withdraw their JKP if they have been a participant for at least 12 months\u8212\'20\'14starting February 2, 2021\u8212\'20\'14and have paid monthly premiums for at least six months straight. The cash benefit for workers who are unemployed is only provided for six months. For the first three months, the benefit paid is 45 percent of the salary, and 25 percent for the following three months. Besides providing cash benefit, the JKP also provides access to jobs and training for workers who have been fired.\par \par \uc2 It was the existence of the JKP that became the manpower ministry\u8217\'20\'19s reason to stop disbursing the JHT for unemployment. After the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  was harmonized at the ministry of justice, at the end of last year the manpower ministry again invited the tripartite forum\u8217\'20\'19s workers body to partake in a discussion titled Returning to JHT\u8217\'20\'19s Philosophy for Prosperous Workers in Old Age at the Grand Meli\u225\'00\'E1 Hotel in Jakarta, January 21. Manpower Ministry\u8217\'20\'19s Director of Worker Social Security Retna Pratiwi hosted the event.\par \par \uc2 Muhammad Sidarta, member of the tripartite forum as well as chairman of the West Java FSPL EM, participated virtually in the event. He recalled that the discussion, which was scheduled for 9am, was delayed for two hours. \u8220\'20\'1CSo it was very short, cutting it close with Friday prayer,\u8221\'20\'1D said Sidarta. He insisted on calling the event a dialogue. \u8220\'20\'1CNot a decision-making.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Sidarta admitted that the manpower ministry does not need the tripartite forum\u8217\'20\'19s permission to issue Permnaker No. 2/2022. The \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is still legit. \u8220\'20\'1CBut not legitimate,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, although the JKP program is already in place, Sidarta feels that the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  of withholding JHT funds until participants have reached 56 years old is not appropriate. \u8220\'20\'1CThe momentum is not right,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. Layoffs can still happen during the Covid-19 pandemic that is still ongoing and the great \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Plus, the promised JKP is not yet tested.\par \par \uc2 There is suspicion that the new \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is not meant only to return JHT\u8217\'20\'19s function to its initial purpose but is also meant to help the government cover the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CFrom the perspective of \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  politics, it seems that the government wants the JHT to stop being claimed, so that the funds can be redirected to government bonds,\u8221\'20\'1D said BPJS Watch Advocacy Coordinator Timboel Siregar on February 15.\par \par \uc2 Compared to other BP Jamsostek programs, the JHT is indeed the prima donna. As of December 2021, JHT\u8217\'20\'19s funds had reached Rp372.5 trillion. As much as 65 percent of the funds were invested into bonds\u8212\'20\'1492 percent of which to government bonds. The placement makes BP Jamsostek one of the largest local investors in government bonds, which are needed to cover the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Tempo has already asked for a complete explanation on the polemic surrounding the new JHT \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  from Minister Ida Fauziyah.

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Finance Minister \uc2 Sri Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  in a virtual press conference on Tuesday predicts Indonesia will log 4,8 - 5,5 percent \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth for 2022 despite being hit by a sudden spread of the Covid-19 omicron variant.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Finance Ministry still sees the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in 2022 to be around 4,8 and 5,5 percent,\u8221\'20\'1D said the Minister on February 22.\par \par \uc2 She projects the first quarter of this year will see a year-on-year growth between 4,5 - 5,2 percent backed by the 5,7 purchase managers index level showing expansion for five consecutive months.\par \par \uc2 Despite acknowledging \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  surrounding the omicron variant as a challenge, she remains optimistic about the continuity of an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery. Mulyani said the performance of the State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  early into 2022 is still on track and expects it to continue in the following months despite logging a receipt lower than January.\par \par \uc2 She argues that Indonesia is one of a small number of countries under the G20 and ASEAN-6 whose \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is growing prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s GDP at 101.6 (1,6 percent) is above the pre-covid GDP.\par \par \uc2 One of the factors that increase Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience is the trade balance which continues to log surpluses for 21 consecutive months. In January 2022 the trade balance posted a surplus of up to US$ 930 million.\par \par \uc2 Exports in January reached US$ 19.16 billion (25.31 percent growth) that is mainly driven by non-oil and gas exports, such as mineral fuels, animal fats, vegetable CPO and machinery and electronic equipment.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, imports reached US$ 18.23 billion or grew 36.77 percent, dominated by goods that support production, namely raw materials and capital goods. Despite performances showing a good direction and rhythm towards \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery, Sri Mulyani argues this condition must be maintained because the challenges ahead still need to be watched out for.\par \par \uc2 Read: Sri Mulyani: Global \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Recovers But Remains Uneven\par \par \uc2 MUHAMMAD HENDARTYO\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2020/02/20/id_916827/916827_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020220223ei2n0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FEATURES\par \b \uc2 ERADICATING CORRUPTION WITHIN SOES\b0\par\par\uc2 1,329 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 February 2022\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Azis Kurmala\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - In October 2021, former \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  commissioner Peter Ghonta took the lid off various problems brewing in the company.\par \par \uc2 Gontha urged the \uc2 State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Ministry\uc2  to dismantle past cases of alleged corruption in the company related to aircraft leasing.\par \par \uc2 He cited issues related to powerful groups in the company and the price difference between \uc2 Boeing\uc2  777-300ER aircraft rental and CRJ1000 aircraft purchase.\par \par \uc2 Ghonta spoke of having reported the problems to several institutions ranging from the director-general of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights to the chairman of the \uc2 Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK)\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Minister Erick Thohir then filed a report on an alleged graft case in the financially beleaguered state-owned airline PT Garuda Indonesia (Persero) \uc2 PT Garuda Indonesia\uc2  (Persero) to the Attorney General"s Office.\par \par \uc2 The report outlines the government"s plan to restructure \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  as well as provides evidence regarding the procurement of ATR 72-600 aircraft.\par \par \uc2 We provide evidence from the investigative audit, so it is not an accusation, he asserted.\par \par \uc2 For the past two years, \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  had faced a financial storm due to past mismanagement that caused the company"s debt to swell to more than Rp140 trillion, Thohir remarked.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Thohir noted that the \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  case was not just about an aircraft but pertaining to an ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 He encouraged the \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  case to be resolved, as it was impossible to buy or rent an aircraft without a business plan and without calculating flight routes.\par \par \uc2 In the absence of such a calculation, Garuda ultimately paid the aircraft rental fee of up to 28 percent to the lessor as compared to only eight percent to other airlines" aircraft lessors.\par \par \uc2 "Hence, there is a system and there is a solution, so that in the future, Garuda will not repeat similar cases again since due to no management, the loss will also affect the people, in the form of expensive tickets,\u8221\'20\'1D he pointed out.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the \uc2 SOEs Ministry\uc2  has taken steps to restructure and salvage the state-owned airline.\par \par \uc2 The ministry will focus on transforming the airline to make it more accountable, professional, and transparent.\par \par \uc2 More than 470 creditors have submitted claims of up to US$13.8 billion, or equivalent to Rp198 trillion, to \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  as of January 5, 2022, as part of a debt recast.\par \par \uc2 The figure has been cited by Garuda Indonesia"s Suspension Debt Payment Obligation (PKPU) team, Thohir remarked.\par \par \uc2 After the verification is completed, the PKPU team will take a decision on January 19, 2022, regarding the amount considered to be valid and can be included in the restructuring process, he remarked.\par \par \uc2 The Garuda management had earlier submitted a proposal to reduce its liabilities by more than 60 percent, from US$9.8 billion to US$3.7 billion through restructuring.\par \par \uc2 The proposal aimed to help the company survive amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has protracted for two years.\par \par \uc2 Save Garuda\par \par \uc2 Commission VI of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  formed a working committee to rescue national carrier \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "In principle, the Committee for Rescuing Garuda is a follow-up to the three work meetings undertaken by Commission VI with the SOEs minister, deputy ministers, and the \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  Board of Directors,\u8221\'20\'1D Head of the Committee for Rescuing Garuda Martin Manurung stated.\par \par \uc2 Manurung explained that the working committee will work not only to look for management issues within the state-owned airline but also to explore options offered by the government.\par \par \uc2 The deputy chairman of Commission VI stated that the formation of the working committee was also a form of political support for Commission VI of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  for \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  to stay afloat.\par \par \uc2 "We want \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2 , as a national flag carrier, to be able to stay in the air, to be able to fly, as an airline of national pride," Manurung noted.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir expressed support for the establishment of a working committee by Commission VI of the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR RI) to rescue and reform national carrier \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Establishment of the working committee is proof of DPR RI"s concrete support and commitment to monitoring the state-owned airline"s rejuvenation process, the minister noted.\par \par \uc2 The political support that the legislature has exhibited would be key to rescuing the flag carrier, the minister noted while adding that his ministry is committed to cooperating with the parliament"s working committee for seeking solutions to remedy issues that have plagued the national airline.\par \par \uc2 The ministry will also inform the working committee, which will monitor the airline"s restructuring and reform progress, about Garuda Indonesia"s future business and reform plan, he added.\par \par \uc2 The State-Owned Enterprises Ministry cannot rescue the airline alone, and we need to collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including DPR RI"s Commission VI, in mending \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2 , Thohir remarked.\par \par \uc2 Transforming \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  is a must to ensure the flag carrier survives amid the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and to ascertain that it records positive performance after the pandemic, he noted.\par \par \uc2 The ministry has also collaborated with the Attorney General"s Office to investigate allegations of corruption by the airline management in the past, the state firm minister remarked.\par \par \uc2 Thorough reforms in the law enforcement and business aspects are expected to bolster Garuda Indonesia"s performance to become more accountable, professional, and transparent in the future, Thohir affirmed.\par \par \uc2 Jiwasraya, Pension Fund\par \par \uc2 Efforts to eradicate corruption by the minister are also being made in the insurance business sector.\par \par \uc2 Thohir revealed that the completion of Jiwasraya\u8217\'20\'19s mega scandal case provided a solution for the aggrieved parties.\par \par \uc2 "However, what distinguishes us from other corruption cases is that the Jiwasraya case has a solution for those who were harmed. It is not a pending case for which there is no explanation. Those who were harmed will be recompensated for their losses,\u8221\'20\'1D Thohir stated.\par \par \uc2 The minister drew attention to no solution being found to this day in several cases of corruption in pension funds and insurance. No refund was offered to the cheated parties.\par \par \uc2 For instance, the case of illegal online loans where no perpetrators or masterminds had yet been revealed and no refund was provided to the victims and deceived parties.\par \par \uc2 Thohir affirmed that the collaboration was necessary to solve the Jiwasraya case.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  gave directions that the Jiwasraya case should be solved immediately.\par \par \uc2 After looking at the facts and evidence, an audit investigation from the Development Finance Comptroller (BPKP) and a report from the \uc2 Supreme Audit Agency (BPK)\uc2 , the Ministry of SOEs officially reported the Jiwasraya case to the Attorney General"s Office.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Ministry of SOEs does not want to become trapped in legal problems, and it focuses on corporate issues,\u8221\'20\'1D the minister stated.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Thohir will fix pension funds in state-owned enterprises comprehensively this year.\par \par \uc2 The pension fund has become a breeding ground for corruption, with the pensioners" bills not being paid in the end, he pointed out.\par \par \uc2 To this end, the minister of SOEs urged Commission VI of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  to jointly conduct a focus group discussion on exposure regarding pension funds.\par \par \uc2 "We are ready, but we cannot clean it up right away, as there is a binding law. Hence, the Ministry of SOEs cannot intervene,\u8221\'20\'1D Thohir noted.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, he remarked that comprehensive improvement in pension funds in the state firm became one of the SOE Ministry"s programs in 2022.\par \par \uc2 The existence of state-owned companies aims to provide the greatest profits to the state.\par \par \uc2 Thereafter, the profits will be channeled back through various programs for the people, starting from infrastructure development to welfare improvement, and others.\par \par \uc2 There is no place for corruption within SOEs.\par \par \uc2 The accountability, transparency, and anti-graft approaches must continue to be implemented to build prosperous SOEs.\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/S022/S022) 25-02-2022 18:30:02\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220225ei2p001ba\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Party leaders float proposal to extend Jokowi's term\b0\par\par\uc2 Yerica Lai, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 974 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The political decision by the government and the \uc2 General Elections Commission (KPU) \uc2 to seal the date for the upcoming presidential election has failed to quash speculations that President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  is seeking to extend his term beyond 2024.\par \par \uc2 The speculation resurfaced last week after three leaders of the ruling coalition parties publicly suggested that the next elections be postponed, citing the prolonged pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian war that is expected to have a global ripple effect.\par \par \uc2 'Big' \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  support\par \par \uc2 National Awakening Party (PKB) chairman Muhaimin Iskandar was the first political bigwig to make the call, saying that the elections should be delayed by one or two years so that they would not "disrupt \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery" amid the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 "The transition of power and government usually results in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  that could disrupt the atmosphere and momentum for very good \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery, especially after the [\uc2 Group of 20\uc2  meeting]," he said in a statement on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Muhaimin, who has expressed his intention to run for president but has failed to gain significant support based on surveys by credible pollsters, claimed that his proposal was backed by "big data analysis" of social media conversations, in which 60 percent of Indonesians supported the idea of postponing the election.\par \par \uc2 It is not clear which data the politician was citing, but he insisted that he would discuss the proposal with the President and other coalition parties.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, National Mandate Party (PAN) chairman Zulkifli Hasan outlined five reasons why the elections should be postponed. One of them was the global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  caused by the fresh armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which he said would disrupt the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , including that of Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi, he further argued, still had a high \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  approval.\par \par \uc2 Also on Thursday, Golkar Party chairman \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2  claimed to have received aspirations from local oil palm farmers in Siak, Riau, who wished for Jokowi's presidential term to be longer. "We will discuss this aspiration with the leaders of other political parties; for us, the Golkar Party, the aspirations of the people are the aspirations of the party," Airlangga said.\par \par \uc2 Not all parties on board\par \par \uc2 The proposal, however, has received strong opposition from at least two ruling coalition parties, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and the NasDem Party.\par \par \uc2 Responding to the development, PDI-P secretary-general Hasto Kristiyanto said his party would stick to the Constitution and five-year election cycle. "The five-year election cycle forms a democratic culture. This culture is highly correlated with the quality of democracy. If it is disturbed, it will result in political instability ... [and] serious consequences for the regeneration of the state leadership that has been built," Hasto said.\par \par \uc2 "Instead of thinking about postponing the election, it is better we continue taking steps to consolidate in preparation for the election."\par \par \uc2 NasDem Party central board executive Ahmad Ali said that his party opposed such an idea and suggested that parties refrain from putting out controversial statements that would only spark political turmoil.\par \par \uc2 "We are sticking to the government and the \b \highlight22\uc2 House\b0 \highlight\uc2  [\b \highlight22\uc2 of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2 '] agreement; the election will be held in February 2024. There has been no change," he said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Gerindra Party has not commented on the issue, but its secretary-general Ahmad Muzani told reporters on Friday his party was still focussing on its agenda gearing up for the 2024 elections to win with its chairman \uc2 Prabowo Subianto\uc2  as the next president.\par \par \uc2 The opposition parties have strongly rejected the proposal and even accused the President, who has repeatedly played down the speculations, of harboring a personal ambition to stay in power beyond his term limit.\par \par \uc2 "We know that this is what Pak Jokowi wants, not what [the ruling coalition] parties want," Andi Arief of the Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, said.\par \par \uc2 The President, he added, needed to be transparent and explain his intention to extend his power. "We are waiting for his words," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mixed \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  response\par \par \uc2 Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, the largest and most influential Islamic organizations in the country, have responded differently to the proposal.\par \par \uc2 Abdul Mu'ti, the secretary-general of Muhammadiyah, warned that extending the current administration would have great political and moral consequences for the nation, and asked every party to have a clear head to think about the long-term impact.\par \par \uc2 "I think we need to have a clear head and think about this in the long term, about the political and moral consequences in the construction of the state administration as well as other considerations concerning the interests of the nation as a whole," he said.\par \par \uc2 NU chairman Yahya Cholil Staquf has been more receptive, saying that the proposal was worth considering. "There is a proposal to postpone the election. I think it makes sense given the problems facing the country," he said as quoted by Antara on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 A national dialogue is needed to discuss the issues, he said, adding, "We will see what we need to do to ease the burdens of the nation."\par \par \uc2 Experts, however, have noted the current development as "deeply troubling" and warned that delaying elections and extending the current presidential term would have grave consequences for the country's young democracy.\par \par \uc2 Firman Noor, a senior political researcher of the Center of Political Research at the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), noted that any attempt seeking to extend the presidential term was a huge betrayal of the hard-won democratic reform implemented after the fall of the New Order in 1998.\par \par \uc2 "These dangerous ideas came from traitors of reformasi [the reform movement]. This only proves that our politics at the elite level are undergoing political decay. It is no more a fertile ground of democratic ideas nor attitudes," Firman said.

\par\par \b \uc2 Ukraine crisis: Its strategic implications for Indonesia\b0\par\par\uc2 987 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Keoni Marzuki and Adhi Priamarizki, Singapore\par \par \uc2 What started as a Russian military buildup along the country's border with Ukraine has evolved into a military incursion. On Thursday, President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  crossed the proverbial Rubicon by authorizing a special military operation against Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Reports of missile strikes on major Ukrainian cities and cyberattacks soon followed the announcement. American policymakers were convinced early on that the Kremlin had decided to invade and that the military buildup of over 150,000 Russian troops along the Russia-Ukraine border and Belarus were a tell-tale sign of an offensive.\par \par \uc2 The crisis has shaken global markets and driven energy prices upward, threatening to derail global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 The escalation of tension will inevitably instigate a wider geopolitical ripple beyond the confines of Eastern Europe, affecting the Southeast Asian region and the broader Indo-Pacific.\par \par \uc2 For Indonesia specifically, the continued tension in Eastern Europe has potential strategic implications that Jakarta needs to consider.\par \par \uc2 While Indonesia recently abandoned its plan to purchase Russian-made Su-35 fighters for its defense modernization program in favor of the Dassault Rafale and F-15, Jakarta will continue to operate its existing Sukhoi fighter squadron for the foreseeable future.\par \par \uc2 The escalation of tension resulted in the United States imposing sanctions against Russia and there is a likelihood that Washington would escalate and/or widen its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sanctions to compel Moscow to stand down.\par \par \uc2 If this scenario materializes, Indonesia may face some difficulties in accessing supplies of critical parts and essential equipment for its Sukhoi fighters, in turn affecting the Air Force's Sukhoi fleet's readiness and capability to conduct military exercises and operations.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's defense policymakers also need to take the absence of domestic maintenance, repair and overhaul for comprehensive checks for its Sukhoi fighters into account.\par \par \uc2 The issue was to be remedied under the now-scrapped US$1.14 billion Su-35 deal, which reportedly includes an offset agreement to establish a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia typically sends its Sukhoi fighters to Russia for most demanding maintenance and to Belarus for upgrades.\par \par \uc2 To bolster resiliency and mitigate dependence on Russia, Indonesia had considered Ukrainian MRO facilities as an alternative in the past, but it never materialized.\par \par \uc2 Should tension escalate further and access to Russia and its satellite states get cut off due to \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sanctions and/or other punitive measures, Indonesia needs to consider alternative MRO facilities in other countries, such as India or Vietnam, to maintain its Sukhoi fleet's airworthiness.\par \par \uc2 The escalation of tension in Eastern Europe is also likely to derail the Indonesian Military's (TNI) acquisition of Russian transport helicopters and armored vehicles.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the US Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanction Act (CAATSA) has put the brakes on Indonesia's major defense acquisitions. Washington's set of new sanctions in response to Russian incursion, however, places these defense acquisition programs in jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 Escalation of tension in Eastern Europe would inevitably send ripples of geopolitical \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  into the Indo-Pacific region where major powers' interests converge.\par \par \uc2 To what degree the ripples affect Indo-Pacific regional stability is contingent on whether the US and its \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies are engrossed in Ukraine, which then raises skepticism to its commitment to the Indo-Pacific.\par \par \uc2 In addition, certain countries may discern US preoccupation in Eastern Europe as an opportunity to pursue adventurous policies, emboldening them to take courses of action that may prove detrimental to regional stability.\par \par \uc2 Conversely, failure to respond accordingly to Russia's invasion erodes the US' credibility to defend the "rules-based" order in the eyes of its Asian allies, which has already been bruised by its catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of how the scenarios play out, it is clear that the Ukraine crisis will adversely impact the perception of American leadership in the region and the "rules-based" order it represents.\par \par \uc2 Arguably, the US is not the only actor balancing against China as new regional security groupings such as the Quad and AUKUS emerge.\par \par \uc2 However, it remains the only actor that can project power effectively to challenge China's rising prominence in the region.\par \par \uc2 Without credible and effective American leadership in the region, the more pressing question lies in the constellation of the regional balance of power and whether a reshuffling is to come.\par \par \uc2 Middle-power countries such as Indonesia, and other states in the region will need to carefully navigate the potentially turbulent reshuffling of regional order.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  has expressed concern over the Ukraine-Russia crisis and called on all parties involved to exercise restraint to prevent the tension to escalate uncontrollably.\par \par \uc2 Speaking as host of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  Finance Ministers and \b \highlight22\uc2 Central Bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  Governors Meeting in Jakarta, President Jokowi warned that the crisis would be disruptive to the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which is only recently starting to recover from COVID-19, urging for deescalation and to focus instead on \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's geography and physical distance from Ukraine limit it from playing a direct role that contributes to the resolution of the crisis.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Indonesia has a stake in the crisis; not only direct \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  interests with both countries but also to mitigate spillover effects that potentially impact stability on Indonesia's immediate strategic environment. As a middle-power, Indonesia possesses qualities and foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  assets it can leverage to promote peace.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia has also built on its experience in participating in several peacekeeping missions, an asset it can leverage to play the intermediary role.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Indonesia can leverage its G20 chairmanship to promote crisis resolution, which would improve the prospect of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 _________________\par \par \uc2 Keoni Marzuki and Adhi Priamarizki are, respectively, associate research fellow and visiting fellow at the Indonesia Program of the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies (IDSS), a think tank within the \uc2 S.

\par\par \uc2 BUSSINESS\par \b \uc2 RI'S  \highlight22\uc2 ECONOMY \highlight\uc2  LIKELY TO CONTRACT 0.014% DUE TO RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT\b0\par\par\uc2 438 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2022\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) has projected that the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will contract 0.014 percent this year due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\par \par \uc2 "The war leads to an oil price hike, which will eventually push inflation, particularly volatile price inflation," chief of Indef"s Macroeconomic and Financial Center, Rizal Taufikurahman, said during an online \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  discussion in Jakarta on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The volatile price inflation has begun to move, particularly for such commodities as oil, gas, and meat, he noted.\par \par \uc2 The imminent price rise for foodstuffs during the fasting month of Ramadhan is expected to add to the volatile price inflation, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Moreover, the pandemic is still ongoing so our \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will slow down in the short run," he forecast.\par \par \uc2 He predicted that global crude prices will increase 1.14 percent due to \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  over the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Accordingly, the prices of other commodities will follow suit in view of the vital role of oil in all \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sectors, he explained.\par \par \uc2 The price of meat is expected to increase 0.07 percent, food 0.05 percent, processed food 0.08 percent, and transportation and communication 0.1 percent, he said.\par \par \uc2 He expressed the hope that the government will soon anticipate a possible rise in the prices of various commodities over the short run.\par \par \uc2 "Moreover, we don"t know how long the war will last," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 The drop in Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict will not be significant compared to that of China and the US, which are expected to experience an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  contraction of 0.022 percent and 0.023 percent, respectively, he said.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  grew 3.69 percent in 2021 after having contracted 2.07 percent in 2020, according to Statistics Indonesia (BPS).\par \par \uc2 "In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  expanded 1.06 percent qtq (quarter-to-quarter). If I compare it with the fourth quarter of 2020, it grew 5.02 percent (year-on-year/yoy). Cumulatively, the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  grew 3.69 percent throughout 2021," BPS chief Margo Yuwono said at a press conference in Jakarta on Monday.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  largely hinged on the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.\par \par \uc2 For instance, although the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  contracted 0.74 percent (yoy) in the first quarter of 2021, it performed far better than in 2020, when COVID-19 spread and exerted massive pressure on the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , he added.\par \par \uc2 (T.H-SHT/A/R013/R013) 02-03-2022 21:52:45\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220302ei3200231\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 The Boons of War against the Threat of Interest Hike\b0\par\par\uc2 691 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 March 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 CERTAINLY, a war brings tragedy and catastrophe to humanity. On the other hand, a war also brings extraordinary wealth to some parties. Indonesian commodity tycoons are those lucky ones. Soaring commodity prices, triggered by Russia\u8217\'20\'19s invasion of Ukraine, have made billions of dollar windfall profit for them.\par \par \uc2 Look at the Newcastle coal price, an important benchmark for consumers in Asia. It soared 46 percent in just one day, to US$446 per ton on Wednesday, March 2. Many countries are desperate to find an alternative supply for Russian coal, which has covered their needs up to this point.\par \par \uc2 Beyond its strength in natural gas exports, Russia is also an important player in the international coal market. Russia\u8217\'20\'19s share in global coal trading was 18 percent in 2020. Last year, 70 percent of \uc2 European Union\uc2  thermal coal imports originated from Russia. While South Korea and Japan imported respectively about 20 percent and 10 percent of their needs from Russia.\par \par \uc2 The void in Russian supply has made prices soar sky-high, and no one knows how long it will last. During this \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  period, coal-mining corporations in Indonesia will enjoy an extraordinary amount of additional income. Indonesia is the largest exporter of coal in the world. Last year, the total volume of Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s coal exports was 427 million tons.\par \par \uc2 There is another commodity price jump that favors Indonesia. Russia and Ukraine have so far supplied 75 percent of sunflower oil global market demand. The war puts a halt to this important supply line. As a consequence, the four main edible oils in the world (palm, soy, rapeseed and sunflower) are rising even higher.\par \par \uc2 Before the war broke out, the market for these various edible oils was already tight. The price of palm oil in the international market has been sky high since last year, even doubling to the point that it triggered a cooking oil crisis in Indonesia, the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest palm oil producer. The war has complicated the issue even further. But because of this complication, palm oil producers are reaping profit. In a week from Russia\u8217\'20\'19s invasion, the price of Indonesian palm oil rose another 20 percent.\par \par \uc2 This windfall is not limited to corporations and conglomerates. The Indonesian government also enjoys the boon. Revenues from various \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2  and royalties jump in line with the rise in prices. Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s current account and balance of payment also received a booster injection as export revenues jump significantly.\par \par \uc2 Last year, this jump in commodity prices had served as a safety cushion for Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the midst of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  volatility after it just recovered from the shock of Covid-19. The war now is just extending the duration of that safety cushion. The prices of various commodities that were showing a downward trend going into 2022 are now rising back up because of the war.\par \par \uc2 In the financial market, the war\u8217\'20\'19s boons are also apparent. When various stock exchanges are falling apart in Asia and the rest of the world, stock prices in Jakarta reached their highest point in history. The Jakarta Composite briefly touched 6,996.9 on Tuesday, March 1. The rupiah also remained stable at around Rp14,380 per US dollar.\par \par \uc2 However, the positive sentiments from the jump in commodity prices will strongly clash with negative sentiments due to the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  change by the Federal Reserve. On Friday, March 3, employment data from the United States showed a sign of an overheated \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The US \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  created 678,000 new jobs in February, far above analysts\u8217\'20\'19 expectations.\par \par \uc2 It is not difficult to interpret that data. The Fed needs to put the brakes on it by raising interest and sucking out liquidity. Analysts are betting that the Fed will be aggressive with the rate hike. This \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will cast a negative sentiment to all emerging economies, Indonesia included. And it is here that the gamble will be made whether the negative sentiments can defeat the positive aura of war\u8217\'20\'19s fortunes that still dominate Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s financial market.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2019/08/10/724088/724088_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220307ei360000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Let's fight the decline of constitutional democracy\b0\par\par\uc2 1,017 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 D. Nicky Fahrizal, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post March 1 commentary titled "Whether the 2024 elections are delayed or not, Jokowi will be king" highlights two key messages.\par \par \uc2 First, the high level of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  satisfaction shown in the Kompas national survey, which has been correlated with a wave of high-ranking political parties and hard-line supporters of the President who propose an extension of the presidential term.\par \par \uc2 Second, the valuable lessons from both Sukarno and Soeharto's presidential terms on how democracy should for the umpteenth time, not be betrayed.\par \par \uc2 Another Post article "Party leaders float proposal to extend Jokowi's term" also provides a profound message, namely the weakening of civil society organizations and political parties in responding to the constitutional issue of presidential term limits, which has led to a division of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  opinion.\par \par \uc2 Then, the paper's March 5 editorial titled "Two more years" gave two strong messages about the lessons learned from our past experience with the authoritarian ecosystem under the two presidents and on ways to strengthen our commitment to the upcoming 2024 elections on Feb. 14, 2024.\par \par \uc2 These three important articles invite us to reflect on our commitment to democracy.\par \par \uc2 First, there is the question of why the discourse on extending the current presidential term to three periods could betray our commitment to democracy.\par \par \uc2 This is because the implementation of the presidential term limit has been a long democratic struggle. Article 7 of the original 1945 Constitution did not rigidly stipulate a term limit. Later, two crucial efforts were made to uphold constitutional democracy.\par \par \uc2 The first attempt was through the 1998 People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) Special Session, named MPR Decree No. XIII/1998 that set limits on the President's term in office.\par \par \uc2 The second effort was through the first amendment to Article 7 of the 1945 Constitution to ensure it adopted the MPR decree's provisions. Thus, limiting the presidential term is a political endeavor and a legal necessity in affirming constitutionalism in our democratic ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 Second, if we look at timelines on social media carefully, the issue of the fifth amendment to the 1945 Constitution circulates periodically and is well-orchestrated.\par \par \uc2 In the first wave of constitutional issues circulating online, it was framed by the discourse of the fifth amendment in an effort to restore the authority of the MPR in forming and establishing the State \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Guidelines (GBHN).\par \par \uc2 In the same discourse, the fifth amendment was then directed at extending the presidential term. Regarding this, President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  has firmly rejected the proposal.\par \par \uc2 In early 2022, the term extension proposal resurfaced again, as many used the COVID-19 pandemic, global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the Ukraine-Russia conflict and \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  aspirations as justifications. The argument to extend the term is centered on the mandate to restore the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Thus, as a form of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  control over the government, it is necessary to pay special attention to the available legal instruments, which of course can be misused solely for the sake of power. The question now lies on whether it is used to restore the MPR's authority, or it is intended for the extension of term limits.\par \par \uc2 The first instrument is constitutional engineering through the fifth amendment of the Constitution. There are two things that must be underlined: the quorum requirements and the procedures related to the provisions of the amendment to Article 37 of the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the political maneuvering to successfully achieve the ambitions of the MPR, GBHN issues and presidential term extension would require a supermajority strategy that was used previously to pass the Job Creation Law. This example signals a significant change from rule of law to rule by law.\par \par \uc2 A second instrument is the presidential decree, which has been a revolutionary legal effort. In 1959 a presidential decree was issued during the Sukarno administration that resulted in the dissolution of our democratic institutions and the decline of constitutional democracy.\par \par \uc2 At an operational level, the issuance of such a decree requires total political support from both the political elite and the military, which can now possibly be achieved, given President Jokowi's strong sphere of influence.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the use of a basic structure doctrine to balance political ambitions regarding the extension of the President's office. The doctrine is essentially based on the existence of a basic structure in the Constitution that cannot be changed by the executive or \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  powers, even if the quorum requirements have been met (Jasdeep Randhawa, 2011).\par \par \uc2 Therefore, in the context of the discourse on the presidential term extension, the basic structure doctrine approach provides several key messages.\par \par \uc2 First, in the context of Indonesian democracy, the principle of limiting power is a structure that supports the 1945 Constitution, where it guarantees that power does not become absolute and prevents the formation of an authoritarianism ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 Second, the principle of popular sovereignty, in which the aspirations of the people are the key to the formation of a democratic government, \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  control and the circulation of national leadership in an orderly, transparent, accountable and peaceful manner.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, to answer the polemic of the 2024 elections, a postponement of the elections, accompanied by the extension of the presidential term, is an unconstitutional effort that fundamentally neglects the basic structure of our Constitution, namely the sovereignty of the people.\par \par \uc2 To conclude, it is imperative for every citizen to uphold the principles of constitutionalism and to commit to constitutional democracy. These efforts ultimately build a government and state life that reflects the constitutional system, not solely based on power.\par \par \uc2 Quoting the thought of Franz Magnis-Suseno in Javanese Ethics (1985), in the perspective of Javanese political philosophy, a ruler who abuses and monopolizes power for personal gain is preparing for his or her own downfall.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, President Jokowi must be able to consistently reject all efforts that run counter the Constitution, constitutionalism and \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  reason; all of which reflect the commitment to upholding the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 _________________\par \par \uc2 A researcher at the Politics and Social Change Department, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220309ei3a00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 2024 elections hang in balance, again\b0\par\par\uc2 Yerica Lai, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 871 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Even though the upcoming general elections have been scheduled for Feb. 14, 2024, it is no longer certain that Indonesians will be able to vote that year with the government and the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  dragging their feet on approving the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  for the polls proposed by the election organizers.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  debate over the swelling \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  for the elections have come on the heels of a controversial proposal from three ruling coalition parties -- allegedly at the behest of President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2 's inner circle -- that the elections be postponed for a number of reasons, including higher election costs.\par \par \uc2 The proposal has revived speculation that many in the administration of President Jokowi, whose second term in office has been severely disrupted by an economically crippling pandemic, is seeking to extend his term by delaying the elections for a few years.\par \par \uc2 'Swelling' election cost\par \par \uc2 Until the final days of the last \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  sitting session last month, the House, which is dominated by pro-government parties, had yet to approve the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  proposals from the \uc2 General Elections Commission (KPU)\uc2 , which was asked to look for ways to shorten the election stages -- including the campaign periods -- to cut costs.\par \par \uc2 The KPU had initially proposed Rp 86 trillion (US$6 billion) to fund the concurrent elections in 2024 -- which is three times the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  for the 2019 presidential elections. The House and the government, however, refused to approve the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 , saying that the country was still struggling to revive the pandemic-stricken \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 KPU secretary-general Bernad Dermawan has said that the commission has cut its \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  proposal to Rp 76.6 trillion and it is now waiting for another consultation session with the government and lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "The KPU's proposed election \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  of 76.6 trillion is allocated over four years [2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025]. We will review it again and make it more efficient," Bernad told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 An increase in election costs was inevitable as a result of the rise in the number of voters in 2024, increased costs, as well as the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) for election officials at voting stations, infrastructure development and inflation adjustment, according to KPU commissioner Pramono Ubaid Tantowi.\par \par \uc2 "Indeed there has been a significant increase compared with the KPU's \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the 2019 general elections," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Even though the infrastructure \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  was cut, the [2024] general election funding requirement will still be higher."\par \par \uc2 'Room for efficiency'\par \par \uc2 House Commission II deputy speaker Saan Mustopa of the NasDem Party said that the House did not object in principle to the election \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  proposed by the KPU.\par \par \uc2 "We have absolutely no problem with the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 ; we are just asking for it to be recalculated. Because after being rechecked, it turns out that from the originally proposed Rp 86 trillion, the KPU can reduce it to Rp 76 trillion. Then after being rationalized again, it could be around Rp 60 trillion. This means that there is still room for efficiencies that can be made," he said as quoted by Kompas daily.\par \par \uc2 During the last meeting of House Commission II, which oversees home affairs, both lawmakers and the government asked the KPU to carry out a simulation to condense election stages and cut more costs.\par \par \uc2 Saan added that the election \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  would be discussed once the upcoming House sitting session started in mid-March.\par \par \uc2 "We will discuss this at the next session. As soon as it starts, we will try to finish it by March or April. Because, in mid-April, we will be back in recess. After that, there will be the fasting month [of Ramadan] and Idul Fitri. So the best time to allow flexibility for the stages is during this upcoming simulation," Saan said.\par \par \uc2 Critical moment\par \par \uc2 Hadar Nafis Gumay, executive director of the Network for Democracy and Electoral Integrity (Netgrit), said the approval of the proposed election \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  served as one of the indicators that the executive and \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  were still committed to holding elections according to the schedule.\par \par \uc2 "If they are serious about supporting the idea that the 2024 general elections should be carried out as scheduled, the House and government need to immediately make the decision on the election funding," Hadar said.\par \par \uc2 Ahmad Khoirul Umam, managing director of Paramadina \b \highlight22\uc2 Public Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Institute, warned that after political maneuvering to postpone the upcoming elections, in which palace circles were reportedly involved, which failed to consolidate in the legislature, the alternative move could be forcing the KPU to declare its "incapacity" to hold the upcoming elections.\par \par \uc2 "The crucial moment falls during the next couple of months. If the KPU's hands and feet are tied by the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the allocation of election funding, technical problems in the preparation of the 2024 general elections will arise," Umam said.\par \par \uc2 Umam added that this could lead to the KPU declaring its unpreparedness to hold the elections.\par \par \uc2 "At that point, elements of predatory forces around the Presidential Palace and political parties supporting the postponement of the election will wash their hands and pass the blame for the inability to hold the 2024 general elections on time to the KPU."

Russia\u8217\'20\'19s invasion into Ukraine, which has no clear endgame so far, adds to the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Investment relocation to countries with lower risks seems inevitable. It would be a serious challenge for the Indonesian market to stop this \u8216\'20\'18bleeding\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 In the second week of March, foreign capital exited, both the stock market and the government bond market. From the stock exchange, Rp10.7 trillion of foreign funds took flight out. As for the bond market, Rp18 trillion left the country from March 1 to 9. Fortunately, the market has remained calm.\par \par \uc2 In this dire time of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil, Indonesia is still blessed with good fortunes. This country currently is enjoying a huge windfall export revenue due to the sharp increase in the price of its main export commodities, such as coal, palm oil, and nickel. This is the cushion that secured our stability. So, even as foreign portfolio investment keeps leaking out, everything seems fine. The rupiah did not show much movement at around Rp14,300 per US dollar.\par \par \uc2 However, the situation is definitely is far from safe. The rise in commodity prices, especially energy and food, does not only bring fortune, but also a big problem: inflation with a very long chain of consequences. For example, the cooking oil crisis that is still ongoing. The government\u8217\'20\'19s effort to fight the market proved futile. Mandatory price ceiling regulations only make cooking oil disappear from the market. Across the country, people have to endure a long queue just to buy a pack of cooking oil.\par \par \uc2 The soaring crude oil price could trigger a similar problem. If it remains high for a long period, it would be impossible for the government to force \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  to keep fuel prices low. Giving \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  is not an option either as the government does not have enough money to do so.\par \par \uc2 This is indeed Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s biggest challenge this year: how to finance the government\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  in this time of turmoil. The government is facing a huge market risk. For financing the 2022 \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the government has to sell various kinds of bonds with a total value of Rp991.3 trillion. Who would have the capacity to absorb so much bonds when \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  are rising and global liquidity is tightening?\par \par \uc2 It seems that foreign investors are no longer reliable. These days, they are busy seeking safe havens. Meanwhile, domestic investor capacity is already touched its maximum limit. Indonesian banks, for one, have parked Rp1,700 trillion in government bonds as of March 9, 2022. That value equals 28.3 percent of third party funds kept by the banks. As a comparison, at the end of January 2020, just before the pandemic, national banks invested only Rp740 trillion into government bonds or around 12.4 percent of its third party money.\par \par \uc2 It is possible that the government will once again ask \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  to buy bonds directly to shoulder its \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14in other words, debt monetization. However, this \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is risky. Debt monetization might damage Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s credibility. Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s government bonds can be even less attractive to foreign investors.\par \par \uc2 So far, as of March 2, the government has only realized Rp184 trillion of bond sales from the target of Rp991 trillion. All of them were for rupiah-denominated bonds in the domestic market. Meanwhile, foreign currency denominated bond offerings in the international market have not been realized. While this goes on, the situation of the global financial market will grow even more volatile. The government would face greater challenges in financing its \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 . And, it would be getting very expensive as well.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/03/13/796439/796439_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220314ei3d0000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: Anticipating the inflation surge\b0\par\par\uc2 1,291 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Faisal Rachman, Mandiri,\par \par \uc2 Rising inflation as a global phenomenon\par \par \uc2 The COVID-19 pandemic has muted global inflation. According to the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 , the global inflation rate eased to 1.9 percent in 2020. Some countries even experienced deflation.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the pandemic, many countries imposed \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity restrictions or lockdowns to curb the virus outbreak.\par \par \uc2 These restriction measures caused global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activities to flag, leading to a recession as the decline in mobility inevitably weakened overall demand.\par \par \uc2 Fragile demand further discouraged investment and production activities. Thus, the pandemic severely hit both demand and supply sides of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , cooling down consumer and production cost inflation.\par \par \uc2 To overcome the pandemic crisis, most countries poured massive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic stimulus\b0 \highlight\uc2  into the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  by shifting \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  dan monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to an accommodative stance. Money supply, hence, increased in a hope to stimulate \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activities to return gaining steam.\par \par \uc2 Along with vaccinations which allowed lockdown lifting, the \b \highlight22\uc2 stimulus\b0 \highlight\uc2  resulted in a remarkable outcome as global output managed to rebound in 2021.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, global inflation jumped to around 5 percent amid the return of demand-pull and cost-push inflation during the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization progress.\par \par \uc2 Despite a flooding money supply and pent-up demand, the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery imbalance is also a major contributor to the rising global inflation.\par \par \uc2 Advanced countries could provide wider access to vaccinations in contrast with developing countries. This caused the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery of the former group to be relatively faster compared with the latter group.\par \par \uc2 Yet most developing countries are global raw material and energy suppliers, and the supplies produced in the early stages of their gradual recovery could not catch up with robust and rapid improvement in demand of the advanced countries.\par \par \uc2 This issue consequently triggered the global supply chain disruption and energy crisis.\par \par \uc2 Approaching the end of 2021, the global commodity and energy prices soared drastically, leading to production cost hike. The inflation came back faster, spiked more markedly and was more stubborn and persistent than previously anticipated.\par \par \uc2 In early 2022, this unfavorable situation is exacerbated by the escalating geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine, which are global main suppliers for energy, metals and grains, including oil, gas, coal, palladium, nickel, aluminum, wheat, corn and sunflower oil.\par \par \uc2 Global prices for a wide range of commodities and energy have further climbed to a level not been seen in years. The conflict threatens staple crop supplies, inflicting a risk of the global food inflation.\par \par \uc2 Inflation is now becoming the major concern in the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery path. It will increase the risk of a global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown amid the already priced-in expectations of a more aggressive pace of monetary tapering, \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  rate hikes and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal stimulus\b0 \highlight\uc2  reduction.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's inflation is on the rise\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's inflation pattern was slightly different from the global inflation rate. In 2020 -- 2021, Indonesia recorded muted inflation as it laid below \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2 's (BI) 3 percent plus-minus 1 percent inflation target.\par \par \uc2 While the 2020 inflation rate was subdued due to the pandemic, 2021 inflation was more of a result of various \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  incentives for consumers and a delay in supply-side inflation, passing through to demand-side inflation by producers amid still weak \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  purchasing power.\par \par \uc2 The producer price index inflation (8.77 percent) was already well above the consumer price index inflation (1.87 percent) at the end of 2021.\par \par \uc2 So, what will happen to inflation in 2022, particularly against the backdrop of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine?\par \par \uc2 Headline inflation jumped to a 20-month high of 2.18 percent year-on-year (yoy) in January 2022. In the following month, it slightly eased to 2.06 percent yoy amid the COVID-19 restrictions related to the Omicron variant outbreak and a new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on the maximum retail price for cooking oil.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  decreased volatile price inflation from 3.35 percent yoy to 1.81 percent yoy. Yet, it inclines to accelerate again in March 2022 as food prices seasonally rise nearing Ramadan.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, Russia's war on Ukraine may adversely affect the wheat supply as Indonesia is heavily dependent on wheat imports from Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Wheat is a key ingredient for noodles, flour and bread producers, and its supply disruption will increase the price. The conflict has also caused global LNG and oil prices to climb, making the government increase non-subsidized LPG and some non-subsidized fuel prices. Administered price inflation, therefore, hiked to 2.34 percent yoy in February.\par \par \uc2 Core inflation rose to an 18-month high of 2.03 percent yoy. It was mostly due to the gold price increase amid the conflict, which has escalated \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the financial market.\par \par \uc2 The three inflation components suggest that headline inflation is on a rising trajectory going forward. Other upside pressures for 2022 inflation rate are the producer cost pass-through to consumer which has been long delayed, and the value-added \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  rate hike from 10 percent to 11 percent.\par \par \uc2 What should the government do?\par \par \uc2 Commodity price rises generally have a positive impact on Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  since growth currently remains commodity centric. Higher commodity prices are associated with higher \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 It may boost investment activity and export performance, especially in the agriculture and mining sectors, which will increase income in general, thus encouraging more private consumption.\par \par \uc2 This in consequence may boost investment in other sectors. The government revenue also will increase, both in \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  and non-\b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue (export duty and royalties).\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, the better the export performance is, the higher the trade surplus could be. It will improve the current account balance condition, therefore reducing the need for financing in foreign currencies and ultimately maintaining foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the Rupiah exchange rate stability. This may reduce imported inflation risks.\par \par \uc2 However, the commodity price rise may create challenges for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  due to its inflationary risk. An inflation hike coinciding with an accelerated \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery will heat up inflationary pressure.\par \par \uc2 While it is true that higher government revenue may support food, fuel and energy \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  or the cash transfer program, there is a need for the government to achieve \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation or bring the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  back to below 3 percent of GDP by 2023.\par \par \uc2 As it is \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  how long the Russia and Ukraine conflict will last, \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  may transform into an issue in a longer term.\par \par \uc2 The potential for a higher trade surplus could be limited if imports also surge. Indonesia is a net oil importer, and wheat supply in the domestic market heavily relies on import.\par \par \uc2 Hence, there is still a serious risk of imported inflation.\par \par \uc2 The maximum retail price \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can be effective only in the short term since it will trigger overdemand, creating a shortage and instead price spike.\par \par \uc2 The government needs to carry out more massive market operations, not only at the consumer level, but also at the producer and distributor level.\par \par \uc2 Further, to manage potential scarcity amid the rising commodity prices, the implementation of the domestic market obligation (DMO) for coal must be closely monitored.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the synchronization between a DMO increase for CPO and the implementation of the B30 biodiesel \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  needs to be further enhanced to prevent a scarcity of raw material for cooking oil.\par \par \uc2 The government should from now on look for alternative countries to import foodstuffs, such as wheat, which is usually harvested between July and September.\par \par \uc2 Higher inflation is unavoidable in 2022. Yet, the upsurge needs to be retained at a level that will not substantially hamper the progress of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Rapidly rising inflation may weaken consumption and force \uc2 BI\uc2  to raise its benchmark rate sooner than anticipated.\par \par \uc2 This could discourage investment activities, thereby reducing the potential for a faster \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery in 2022.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220315ei3g00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 GoTo to build up war chest through IPO amid fiercer competition\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 848 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Homegrown tech giant GoTo Group plans to raise Rp 17.99 trillion (US$1.26 billion) through an initial \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  offering (IPO) at the \uc2 Indonesia Stock Exchange\uc2  (IDX), in a move that analysts say is essential for the company to win over the Indonesian market from competitors.\par \par \uc2 GoTo issued its prospectus on Tuesday, revealing that 10 percent of the IPO funds will be set aside for its business arms in Singapore and Vietnam. The rest will go to its business in Indonesia, with GoTo and e-commerce arm Tokopedia getting 30 percent each, e-wallet GoPay getting 25 percent and multifinance arm PT Multifinance Anak Bangsa (\uc2 MAB\uc2 ) getting 5 percent.\par \par \uc2 "With our future business strategy, there are a lot of investments to be made in technologies and various resources," GoTo CEO \uc2 Andre Soelistyo\uc2  said on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The prospectus was issued a few months after Gojek and Tokopedia announced their merger to form GoTo Group on May 17, 2021, in response to tightening competition for Southeast Asia's largest digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  from Singapore-based ride-hailing giant Grab and Singapore's \uc2 SEA Limited\uc2 , the publicly listed parent of e-marketplace Shopee.\par \par \uc2 Andre also reaffirmed GoTo's plan to undergo a dual-listing, even though it was not yet finalized. The company is reported to be planning a listing in the United States.\par \par \uc2 GoTo posted a Rp 7.59 trillion loss in July last year, narrowing the Rp 10.05 trillion loss posted during the same period in 2020. Without specifying a timeline, Andre said the company had laid out several strategies to turn a profit, such as increasing user and transaction volumes to raise commission and marketplace fee revenues while slashing expenses by improving logistics and automating user acquisition and retention using machine learning.\par \par \uc2 "Therefore, growth in revenue would be faster than the rise in expenses, automatically granting our company a profit," Andre said.\par \par \uc2 In the IPO, GoTo seeks to raise at least Rp 15.2 trillion, along with an additional Rp 2.3 trillion if a greenshoe option was exercised. The figure is lower than that of the first unicorn IPO in Indonesia, Bukalapak (BUKA), which raised $1.5 billion last year.\par \par \uc2 GoTo is offering its share under the ticker GOTO at between Rp 316 and Rp 346 apiece. The company is aiming for a market cap of between Rp 376.6 trillion and Rp 413.7 trillion, which would be third-largest in the IDX behind private lender \uc2 Bank Central Asia\uc2  and state-owned \uc2 Bank Rakyat Indonesia\uc2 , even though the share price is much lower than Bukalapak's pricetag of Rp 800 apiece.\par \par \uc2 With our future business strategy, there are a lot of investments to be made in technologies and various resources.\par \par \uc2 David Agus\uc2 , managing director at \uc2 PT Trimegah Sekuritas Indonesia\uc2 , which is also one of GoTo's underwriters, said on Tuesday that the stock price was was set based on current market conditions and GoTo's future prospect.\par \par \uc2 "Investors ought to see in the long term, especially the potential of digital business growth in Indonesia," he said at the same event.\par \par \uc2 He added that the greenshoe option provided a means to stabilize share prices up to a month after the listing. The additional shares are being held as treasury stocks so that investors' share prices would not be diluted if the option was exercised.\par \par \uc2 GoTo offers between 48 billion and 52 billion shares, or 4.35 percent new shares issued in this IPO, which falls short of the bourse's minimal of 7.5 percent, but the company did not say how it would meet that requirement.\par \par \uc2 The company also became the first in Indonesia to use the newly issued multiple voting share (MVS) \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which enable founders and early investors to retain control over the company.\par \par \uc2 Nailul Huda, who heads the Center of Innovation and Digital \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef), said on Tuesday that GoTo's lower share price reflected a well-adjusted expectation amid \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in tech company stocks after Bukalapak shares flopped by losing more than half of their initial offer price.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, investors in Indonesia were not as familiar with tech company valuations, which were based on future values instead of current earnings and financial standings.\par \par \uc2 "That means they are not as optimistic as Bukalapak to acquire new capital. They tried to remain realistic amid current market conditions that were not as good as many hoped for," he said.\par \par \uc2 And despite raising less capital, "the funds raised will make GoTo fiercer to go head to head with Shopee and Grab".\par \par \uc2 Sucor Sekuritas equity analyst Paulus Jimmy said on Tuesday that GoTo had bright prospects as Indonesia was expected to undergo rapid digitalization in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 Paulus advised investors to look closely at GoTo's path toward profitability and how well the company delivered on promised growth. But in the short term, the greenshoes option would help keep stock prices stable in the days after the IPO.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220315ei3g00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Peace on the G20 agenda\b0\par\par\uc2 555 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 The world is facing another major \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recession on the heels of the one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This time, it's the result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the series of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sanctions imposed on the aggressor, which have disrupted global trade and financial systems. Given the size of the Russian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the sanctions and the country's isolation will hurt not only Russia, but much of the rest of the world too.\par \par \uc2 We think it would be futile for Indonesia, as this year's president of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2 , to try to keep the war off the agenda. It can try, but the impacts of Russia's invasion are bound to haunt discussions of global health, a sustainable energy transition and digital transformation, the three areas that Indonesia has prioritized.\par \par \uc2 The government has been making elaborate preparations to try to ensure the success of its G20 chairmanship and win national prestige. To make its stamp on the group, the country is looking for deliverables during its leadership, which will peak with a summit in Bali scheduled for October.\par \par \uc2 Much of the plan to support the 2022 motto "recover together, recover stronger" was made last year, and many of its assumptions about the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  have now proven incorrect. We are entering an \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  time, but a recession is a near certainty.\par \par \uc2 Rather than keeping doggedly to its agenda, Indonesia should be flexible and even prepare to change course in leading the G20. Rather than ignoring the issue, Indonesia should make the war in Ukraine a main part of the agenda. And rather than waiting passively for events to unfold, Indonesia should take an active role in the search for peace.\par \par \uc2 The country faces pressure from some G20 members to expel Russia or exclude it from all the group's activities. Some say they will boycott the October summit in Bali if Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  is invited. Bowing to these demands, however, could lead other members, like China and India, to reconsider their own participation.\par \par \uc2 This is a test of Indonesia's global leadership. Rather than bowing to these pressures, Indonesia should use the presidency to play an active role in mediating peace between Russia and Ukraine and to ease the tensions between Russia and the United States.\par \par \uc2 Some \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  members have called on President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  to use the G20 as a platform to launch peace initiatives. Senior Cabinet members, however, have rejected the idea, saying the G20 was set up as a forum primarily for strengthening the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  system. But given the current situation, the turmoil in the global financial and trade systems cannot be fixed without ending the war first.\par \par \uc2 The G20 cannot skirt the conflict and its impact on the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Indonesia should make Ukraine a central part of discussions at the forum and should not exclude or expel anyone -- at this stage. Instead, Indonesia must bring everyone together to sit down and resolve their differences.\par \par \uc2 Many countries are already offering to help mediate discussions between the parties in conflict. It is not certain that the Ukraine war can be resolved in such a way, but the G20 presidency puts Jokowi in a strong position to make an attempt.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220316ei3g00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 has revised its 2022 global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth forecast downward to 4.2 percent from 4.4 percent citing the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\par \par \uc2 "If (the conflict) continues (growth) can fall to 3.8 percent. It will depend on how long the conflict will continue," \uc2 BI\uc2  Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  said during a press conference following a meeting of BI"s board of governors in Jakarta on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The escalation of the geopolitical tension, which has led to many countries imposing sanctions on Russia, has affected global trade transactions, commodity prices, and financial markets, even as the spread of COVID-19 has begun to show signs of abating, he said.\par \par \uc2 He predicted that \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in Europe, the United States, Japan, China, and India will potentially be lower than projected.\par \par \uc2 A potentially lower-than-projected global trade volume would be in line with the risk of deferred global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery and supply chain disruption, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The global prices of commodities including energy, foods, and metal (have shown an) increase, thereby putting pressure on global inflation," he added.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the escalation of Russia-Ukraine tensions, in addition to the Fed Rate hike and prompt normalization of monetary policies in other developed nations in response to increasing inflationary pressure as a result of the energy price hike, has added to the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  about the global financial market.\par \par \uc2 This condition will lead to limited capital flows due to the risk of reverse capital flows to safe-haven assets and pressure on the exchange rate of developing countries" currencies, Warjiyo said.\par \par \uc2 However, he said he believes domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth will remain strong along with the declining transmission of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 despite the rising risk of Russia-Ukraine geopolitical tension.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is predicted to grow in the range of 4.7\u8211\'20\'135.5 percent this year.\par \par \uc2 (T.H-SHT/A/S022/S022) 17-03-2022 21:39:36\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220317ei3h001e2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Russia-Ukraine war 'real threat' to  \highlight22\uc2 economic \highlight\uc2  recovery\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas , The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 731 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 March 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Finance Minister \uc2 Sri Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  has raised concerns over heightened geopolitical tension, particularly concerning Ukraine, as well as several other factors that could disrupt the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Sri Mulyani, who served as managing director to the \uc2 World Bank\uc2  in the past, said on Wednesday that the Ukraine-Russia conflict created a very high degree of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  as \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sanctions led to an extreme increase in commodity prices, as well as volatility in capital and financial markets.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, risks of supply chain disruption, inflation, unequal vaccination rates and impending global monetary tightening, among many other problems, persisted, she added.\par \par \uc2 "These are all going to be a very real threat for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery both in advanced as well as emerging countries," Sri Mulyani said during a webinar held by credit agency \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The pandemic has triggered supply disruptions in many countries with prices of several key commodities surging to multiyear or even all-time highs.\par \par \uc2 Brent, the international benchmark for oil prices, briefly surpassed US$120 per barrel, double the assumption underlying Indonesia's state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  for this year. Prices of nickel, coal and aluminum, as well as agricultural commodities such as wheat are among those rising the most.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  on Tuesday warned of the risks of slowed growth and skyrocketing inflation.\par \par \uc2 Sri Mulyani said Indonesia could withstand the situation relatively well, arguing the country's high trade surplus and foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  provided a comfortable cushion to the volatility and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , particularly due to its position as a net exporter of commodities.\par \par \uc2 The country remained on the path of \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation as the government worked toward the goal of bringing the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  back to below 3 percent of GDP by 2023, as stipulated in the 2020 law on the COVID-19 response.\par \par \uc2 "I think we are relatively [shielded] from this conflict," Sri Mulyani.\par \par \uc2 However, Sri Mulyani said the government would remain vigilant. The country's inflation was very low compared with many countries, but she was aware that that came at a cost to the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  as a result of fuel and electricity \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This year, the government also plans to raise value added \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  by 1 percentage point, which Sri Mulyani said would be exercised very carefully so as not to weaken the recovery process amid the geopolitical risks.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Rookmaaker, head of Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings at \uc2 Fitch\uc2 , said surging commodity prices would significantly push up Indonesian inflation this year, especially food prices.\par \par \uc2 The effect on fuel prices would remain to be seen due to fuel price \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but Rookmaaker said he expected the government to be forced to act soon if the oil price remained high for longer than anticipated.\par \par \uc2 Given Indonesia's low revenue intake compared with other countries, \uc2 Fitch\uc2  noted the government did not have much flexibility in \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 . This year, the situation would be even more complicated given the significant \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  on infrastructure and the new capital city.\par \par \uc2 "The government will have to have to make choices there," Rookmaaker said at the same event, adding that the options were either hiking administered fuel prices, \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  less on infrastructure developments or deferring \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation, with the latter being the least likely option.\par \par \uc2 On top of that, Rookmaaker expected investment in Indonesia to face some challenges, particularly because of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the implementation of the Job Creation Law after the Constitutional Court ruled it partly unconstitutional. Several scenarios could see investment growth pick up more slowly than expected.\par \par \uc2 Bank Permata\uc2  economist Josua Pardede said at the same event that the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe also had some positive effects on Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as a rise in commodity prices would translate into higher exports, which could help the country's current account balance and offset hikes in prices of imported goods like oil and food.\par \par \uc2 However, he agreed that, at some point, commodity prices would have to normalize as the high prices also had negative side effects through \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  and inflated prices.\par \par \uc2 He expressed the hope that the Russia-Ukraine conflict would gradually ease and that commodity prices might start normalizing in the second half.\par \par \uc2 "In that case the government doesn't have to raise the subsidized fuel price, and we are still expecting that the impact on the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  also will be limited," Josua said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220317ei3h00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

The pandemic has entered its third year, and the world continues to face \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Maharani told delegates here on Monday.\par \par \uc2 According to the speaker, if countries do not work together and are selfish, then several challenges, including the pandemic, will be difficult to handle.\par \par \uc2 "Health problems can develop into social, \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2 , political, or other problems," she said in a press statement.\par \par \uc2 Maharani emphasized that the parliament plays a crucial role in building cooperation between countries.\par \par \uc2 "The parliament also needs to build \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  awareness domestically. While enhancing a sense of love for the homeland, we also need to grow a spirit of global solidarity," she emphasized.\par \par \uc2 In 2022, the IPU session forum is being held at the Bali International Convention Centre (BICC) in Nusa Dua, Bali, on March 20-24. The forum is aimed at unifying global commitments to overcoming various world problems, Maharani stated.\par \par \uc2 "Decisions that are imminent for the global problems and the future are determined here and now," the house speaker remarked.\par \par \uc2 According to Maharani, the parliament has a key role to play in rejecting unilateralism, which she deemed as only prioritizing small groups and momentary interests.\par \par \uc2 It is the first time that Indonesia hosts the IPU annual session.\par \par \uc2 IPU is cross-nation, inter-parliament cooperation that is believed to be the world"s second-largest democratic forum after the United Nations.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-KZU/B/H-FDH/H-FDH) 21-03-2022 13:47:49\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220321ei3l000b5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The \uc2 US Federal Reserve\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s benchmark interest rate hikes have made it difficult for developing countries to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  has opined.\par \par \uc2 "Developing countries must overcome the impact of global growth, \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and the effect of the interest rate increases on capital flows," Warjiyo said at the BI "Leader"s Insight" \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  lecture here on Monday.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the Fed"s benchmark interest rate hikes have also limited the ability of developing countries to formulate policies for encouraging \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, he highlighted.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the normalization of monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is one of the issues raised and discussed at the 2022 Indonesian G20 Presidency, he said.\par \par \uc2 According to Warjiyo, monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization in developed countries should be well-calibrated, well planned, and well-communicated.\par \par \uc2 All of the efforts must be conducted so that the impact of \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization on the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and developing countries can be mitigated properly, he said.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization in developed countries has begun and is likely to be done faster than in other countries, he added.\par \par \uc2 "We have already seen that the Fed has started raising rates. We initially expected that there would be five hikes, but with the high inflation and rapid \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, it is likely the US \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  to (increase the benchmark \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 ) seven times, like this month," Warjiyo said.\par \par \uc2 The hikes in \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  by Fed would have an impact on global rate hikes and perceptions of global risk.\par \par \uc2 Hence, he said, \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization is presenting a challenge amid unbalanced \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in countries.\par \par \uc2 In addition to \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  normalization, countries are facing other challenges, such as the prolonged impact of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he added.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-KZU/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 21-03-2022 21:16:40\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220321ei3l001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Azis Kurmala\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The war in February 2022 had deepened the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis, whereas the world had been acutely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) stated.\par \par \uc2 "When the world started to recover the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , last month, in February 2022, there was a war that made all countries dizzy," President Jokowi noted in a virtual speech at the CNBC Indonesia \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Outlook 2022 in Jakarta, Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In February 2022, Russia declared to start a special military operation into Ukraine that has given rise to global geopolitical tensions to date.\par \par \uc2 President Jokowi remarked that in early 2022, the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  had not fully recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 The propagation effect of restrictions on the mobility of people and goods due to COVID-19 has led to a scarcity of energy sources, food, and containers that can potentially raise inflation.\par \par \uc2 "This (war) will deepen the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis and increase world political tensions," he noted.\par \par \uc2 Political tensions have led to an increase in the prices of oil, gas, and raw materials for fertilizers and wheat. Hence, it is feared that inflation will continue to rise.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese problems are a challenge for many countries, including Indonesia. We must address these challenges very carefully,\u8221\'20\'1D he stressed.\par \par \uc2 The head of state emphasized the importance of collaboration between the government and business actors to implement appropriate policies to accelerate \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery. One form of collaboration is the creation of several investments that become a source of employment and the mobilization of sources of inclusive and equitable \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe need fast and appropriate policies and effective implementation. What is clear is that society must not become a victim of this global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he stated.\par \par \uc2 Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) economist Eisha M. Rachbini had earlier forecast that the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  would potentially widen in 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\par \par \uc2 "Looking ahead, if the oil price persistently hovers at a high level of above US$100 per barrel and essential commodity prices increase, then the government will likely conduct price intervention and provide \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  and social assistance, which will eventually put pressure on the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi projected that each US$1 per barrel rise in the Indonesian crude price (ICP) will raise the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  by Rp1.47 trillion, kerosene \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  by Rp49 billion, compensation to state oil and gas firm \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  by Rp2.65 trillion, and electricity \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  by Rp295 billion.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, state revenues from \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  receipts and non-\b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  state revenues will increase by Rp0.8 trillion and Rp2.2 trillion, respectively, so the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  could potentially widen, Rachbini remarked.\par \par \uc2 The government is expecting the 2022 state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  to reach Rp868 trillion, or 4.8 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP), he noted.\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/S022/S022) 22-03-2022 15:38:00\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220322ei3m000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 BAMBANG Susantono\uc2  and Dhony Rahajoe had long been tipped to fill the posts of Chief and Deputy Chief of the Nusantara Capital City (IKN). But the confirmation came just a day before they were inaugurated by President Joko Widodo on March 10. After that, they were promptly asked to join a closed cabinet meeting and later the Kendi Nusantara ceremony (a ritual to mark the start of the new capital construction) in North Penajam Paser, East Kalimantan. In the two weeks that followed, Bambang and Dhony had to work on their own as they had not been assigned \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  or staff.\par \par \uc2 Bambang said the locals had high hopes in the IKN. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen we were in Penajam, a lot of people came and asked us to hurry up. Like in the Bandung Bondowoso (legend), they want everything to be completed in a flash,\u8221\'20\'1D he quipped during an interview with Tempo reporters Abdul Manan, R.R. Ariyani, Gangsar Parikesit and Caesar Utomo on Monday, March 21. The legend has it that a Javanese princess named Rara Jonggrang asked Prince Bandung Bondowoso to build 1,000 temples overnight as a condition to marry her.\par \par \uc2 In the interview that lasted for about one and a half hours, Bambang and Dhony explained the President\u8217\'20\'19s expectations as well as the IKN project targets for 2024. They also discussed funding schemes and strategies to attract investors for the project.\par \par \uc2 When were you approached to be IKN chief and the deputy chief?\par \par \uc2 Bambang Susantono\uc2 : State Secretariat Minister Pratikno contacted me in the second week of January, and we had a discussion. Since my expertise is in city planning, we discussed about creating a growth center outside of the current one, how to equalize development with the IKN as the equalizer, and about setting up a separate system, for example, IKN-Balikpapan-Samarinda as a growth center which can be further developed, maybe with other islands such as Gorontalo, Manado (North Sulawesi), Makassar (South Sulawesi), Java. And also, how the tasks will be divided and balanced between the IKN and Jakarta which will become a financial hub.\par \par \uc2 Afterwards, I received a call from (Finance Minister) Ibu Sri Mulyani about the possibility to return to Indonesia earlier. My contract with the ADB (\uc2 Asian Development Bank\uc2 ) is running until July and may be extended. I said I would like to complete my assignment if possible. Then ADB President \uc2 Masatsugu Asakawa\uc2  met with President Jokowi on March 8 at the Bogor Palace. During an interval, President made a request for my earlier repatriation. On following Monday after his return to Manila, Asakawa summoned me and said, \u8220\'20\'1CActually, we want you to stay with us but this is in the interests of your country, so, perhaps you need to consider it as your duty.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Dhony Rahajoe: National Development Planning Minister Suharso Monoarfa visited \uc2 Bumi Serpong Damai\uc2  in October, 2021, and President Jokowi on December 24. On January 31, \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Works and People\u8217\'20\'19s Housing Minister Basoeki Hadimoeljono and Pratikno came. In between (the visits), Pak Pratikno called and asked me to send my curriculum vitae. He also invited me to his residence for discussion and asked if I would help with the IKN. To help the team, no problem, of course. In February, Pak Pratikno invited me again. After a long discussion, he asked if I was willing to work with Pak Bambang (Susantono). I asked for some time. I\u8217\'20\'19m not a politician nor a bureaucrat. Meanwhile, this is a huge responsibility. Since (I learned at the time) that Pak Bambang was positive and since Pak Jokowi is also positive, I accepted the job. I only met Pak Bambang for the first time one day before (the inauguration).\par \par \uc2 What expectations did the President have at the time?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: Maybe he saw that the combination of me as a concept designer and Pak Dhony as a building expert fits IKN\u8217\'20\'19s needs.\par \par \uc2 What kind of challenges do you imagine as IKN\u8217\'20\'19s leaders?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: Pak Dhony mentioned three challenges. First, time. Second, time. Third, time. Because we have specific targets for 2024. I would have been more confident if we began two years ago. What from what I understand so far, there is a plan for a ceremony in the IKN and to transfer around 60,000 civil servants and military and police personnel. We both have a vision that if we move people, particularly first settlers, we must think about health care, education, entertainment facilities as well as their daily needs.\par \par \uc2 We are building a city, not just a government hub for which we only need to move or put people there. Building a city means building the soul of that city too and it can only be realized if there are interactions and cohesiveness among its residents. If we look at Naypyidaw (the capital of Myanmar), that has not been achieved. So, it ended up empty. People don\u8217\'20\'19t feel comfortable or cozy. If we visit a city, we can feel if it is cozy or not although it takes time. I informed the President that it may take 15 to 20 years. The process will not be just one or two years. Let the chemistry take its course.\par \par \uc2 Dhony: This is a humongous project. \uc2 Bumi Serpong Damai\uc2  saw a voluntary relocation of 300,000 people over a 30 years period. In this case (IKN), the move is mandatory. If you multiply 60,000 by three (families), we have 180,000 people for immediate relocation. That will immediately create a market. We\u8217\'20\'19ve calculated the needs for clothing, food and lodging and the number of markets that need to be built. We can already include them in the master plan.\par \par \uc2 Then, there is cost. If this is a private sector project, you need to borrow the fund from here and there. But it is already available. Before the IKN, the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  works ministry had a \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  of around Rp100 trillion for construction. We need less than that to build the Palace, the DPR/MPR (parliament) complex and several ministries.\par \par \uc2 Another challenge is the infrastructure development. Road construction needs a huge cost. If it is done by the private sector, they would first calculate loans as infrastructure usually doesn\u8217\'20\'19t give immediate profits. On the other hand, it is precisely the government\u8217\'20\'19s obligation to build infrastructure. That\u8217\'20\'19s easier. Now, we just need to capitalize on all the potentials through a good communication.\par \par \uc2 Did you negotiate the targets that time?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: Pak Jokowi put forward his vision and we listened. Now, we are assessing what moving 60,000 people will look like. Such a huge relocation is not only about building apartments and filling them with people. We also have to think about education, health care and recreation facilities.\par \par \uc2 Dhony: Our company did a study before and found that building a house triggered multiplier effects on 175 industries, such as cement, paper, sewing thread, stamp, transportation, construction nails, bricks, paint, and so on. So many. Then the labor force that include woodworkers, painters and so on, which could be in millions. When the house is completed, it will need rugs, furniture, water dippers, pots and pans, stoves. Around 300 items in all, not to mention food and beverages and other consumption goods. A labor-intensive megaproject like this can support a myriad of industries.\par \par \uc2 What will be the focuses for 2024?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: There are four: preparation, construction, relocation and governance. Now we are in the preparation stage. The first two years is the initial stage. The governance must already begin in 2024. There should already be services in place be it child delivery or whatever, just name it. Based on our plan, the IKN Authority is currently in coordination phase. All major programs are still undertaken by respective ministries and institutions which have DIPA (the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  execution list). We don\u8217\'20\'19t have DIPA yet. We\u8217\'20\'19ve been given time until the end of this year. If we have DIPA in 2023, we are still new too. Our ability to run as an institution will not be as sophisticated as the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  works ministry\u8217\'20\'19s ability to build roads and dams. It takes time to catch up. I think in the next three years, we will be doing mostly coordination while preparing the IKN as an institution to have the capability to carry out development and governance activities.\par \par \uc2 Nusantara Capital City (IKN) Authority Chairman \uc2 Bambang Susantono\uc2  (second from left) and Deputy Chairman Dhony Rahajoe (right) take the oath of office led by President Joko Widodo during the inauguration at the State Palace in Jakarta, March 10. ANTARA FOTO/HO/Setpres-Muchlis Jr\par \par \uc2 What construction activities have already been initiated?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: The Sepaku Dam has been completed. The toll road from the Balikpapan Airport is targeted for (construction) next year. In this second week, we spent more time listening to the ministries and institutions about the programs they already have. We are coming in half way through. Meanwhile, they already have programs. It\u8217\'20\'19s not good either if we decelerate them. So, we let them roll for the next two or three years. Our job is more for coordinating.\par \par \uc2 Dhony: The construction of the Palace and drawings including those for some ministries are being finalized. Right after the inauguration, the media asked what our breakthroughs would be. The law gives us time until 2022 (to put together the institution). (But) people expect us to make immediate progresses here and there.\par \par \uc2 What about the funding schemes?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: It has to be in detail in terms of percentage. We see that the shortest three-year scheme generated market confidence. As regards the private sector\u8217\'20\'19s participation, for sure they want to see the seriousness of the government. It\u8217\'20\'19s like the \u8216\'20\'18chicken and egg\u8217\'20\'19 situation. How much will the government invest? That\u8217\'20\'19s why the APBN (State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 ) is quite crucial because it will be the first anchor to build market or investor confidence. The \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  can also participate through crowdfunding. We will explore all creative financing venues (outside State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 ). Well, as of now we are still a two-man team. And we\u8217\'20\'19re still looking for an office space.\par \par \uc2 When will the presidential \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on IKN institution be issued?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: We hope the presidential \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on the IKN Authority will be issued soon. It covers everything. With that, we can get \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  or recruit staff. One of the criticisms towards the IKN law is insufficient consultation with the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 . We want to have a proper consultation with the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  from the start. There are four draft presidential regulations and two draft government regulations.\par \par \uc2 How will the government make the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  enthusiastic about the consultation?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: I heard from \uc2 Bappenas\uc2  (the National Development Planning Agency) that there was huge \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  enthusiasm when they had consultation sessions in Kalimantan. When we went there (Penajam), a lot of people asked me to hurry up with the project. Like in the Bandung Bondowoso legend, they want everything to be completed in a flash. This \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  consultation will be more thorough as regards the \u8216\'20\'18how tos\u8217\'20\'19. This is more important than what is normatively governed in the law.\par \par \uc2 What will IKN\u8217\'20\'19s future institutional structure be like?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: It will be big. The IKN Authority will govern and regulate. In terms of business, there will be a business entity whether it is owned by the Authority or any other party. Business will be managed separately to make the institution more agile. The Authority will operate like a ministry so there will be bureaucracy. The point is how to make the organization agile while maintaining good governance. That\u8217\'20\'19s why from the beginning we asked to be introduced to the Attorney-General\u8217\'20\'19s Office and the Corruption Eradication Commission.\par \par \uc2 Is there any specific strategy to attract investors?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: Investors will be interested if we can maintain organizational credibility. According to my experience at the ADB, the entry of multilateral institutions is like an assurance because usually they don\u8217\'20\'19t come in if they are \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It gives assurance to investors although their number is small. For example, in these two or three years, we, say, spend from the State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  and use it a leverage to attract investors and build market confidence. We can\u8217\'20\'19t make mistake with this initial model.\par \par \uc2 We will also be discussing more about this massive project, the resources, the availability of materials, etc. We should not neglect the environment. For example, we don\u8217\'20\'19t want to lose or cause destruction to mountains at the locations from where the materials are sourced. As regards investors, we shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t worry too much about them leaving. Investors come and go. We want core of the core from the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the government itself. If there is transparency, accountability and good governance, the market will move on its own.\par \par \uc2 What has been offered to investors?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: We want to showcase what we want from the private sector and what they can get in return. Investors surely want to see what the returns are like. Indeed, there are certain specifics if we talk with domestic investors. For example, \u8220\'20\'1CYou are making a history, you see. If you don\u8217\'20\'19t join, your competitors will.\u8221\'20\'1D For them, there\u8217\'20\'19s a special (sentimental) value that they are investing in a new capital city.\par \par \uc2 How do you convince the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  that this project will not stall?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: We are working in stages as it should be in building a sustainable city from scratch. That\u8217\'20\'19s why the first three years of the project is critical to ensure its continuity.\par \par \uc2 Is there a scenario for the government change and shift in the support for the IKN?\par \par \uc2 Bambang: We are optimistic.\par \par \uc2 Bambang Susantono\par \par \uc2 Place and Date of Birth: Yogyakarta, November 4, 1963\par \par \uc2 Education:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Bachelor in Civil Engineering, Bandung Institute of Technology, 1987;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Master Degree, \uc2 University of California, Berkeley\uc2 , US, 1996;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 PhD, \uc2 University of California, Berkeley\uc2 , US, 2000\par \par \uc2 Career:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Chair, Masyarakat Transportasi Indonesia, 2004-2010;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Deputy for Infrastructure Coordination and Regional Development, Coordinating Ministry\par \par \uc2 For the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , 2007-2010;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Deputy Minister of Transportation, 2010-2014;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Deputy President, \uc2 Asian Development Bank\uc2 , 2015-2022\par \par \uc2 Dhony Rahajoe\par \par \uc2 Place and Date of Birth: Bandung, November 1, 1965\par \par \uc2 Education:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Bachelor of Architecture, Bandung Institute of Technology, 1984-1989\par \par \uc2 Career:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 General Manager, \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Service, and Spokesman, \uc2 Bumi Serpong Damai\uc2 , 2003-2007;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Managing Director, President Office, Sinar Mas Land, 2015-2022;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Commissioner, Inti Tekno Sains, Bandung, 2019-2022\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/03/27/797561/797561_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/03/27/797562/797562_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220328ei3s00001\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Mangkupadi\u8217\'20\'19s Unrealized Dreams\b0\par\par\uc2 1,840 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 March 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 THREE months since inaugurated by President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  on December 21, 2021, the Indonesia Green Industrial Zone (KIHI) development project in Bulungan Regency, North Kalimantan, has yet to start construction. Problems surrounding the project\u8217\'20\'19s location continues: freeing up land owned by residents of the Mangkupadi village in the Tanjung Palas subdistrict. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople\u8217\'20\'19s land acquisition has only reached a few percentage points,\u8221\'20\'1D said Yanto, Mangkupadi village\u8217\'20\'19s head of administrative matters, on Friday, March 25.\par \par \uc2 People\u8217\'20\'19s land acquisition was already initiated in October 2021 by Kawasan Industri Kalimantan Indonesia, a company affiliated to Kalimantan Industrial Park Indonesia, the developer of the industrial zone. That developer group is led by Adaro Energy Indonesia. They must acquire residents\u8217\'20\'19 land in order for the project to reach 30,000 hectares from the current 16,000 hectares. This would potentially make it the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest environmentally friendly industrial complex.\par \par \uc2 The green concept can be read from the developers\u8217\'20\'19 promise to provide the energy from new and renewable energy sources. Thus, the industrial area must be considerable.\par \par \uc2 North Kalimantan has the potential for large hydropower, estimated at 21.95 gigawatts. However, the investment needed has a high price tag. In addition to insufficient infrastructure facilities, the construction of a new power station is a difficult sell for state electricity company PLN, which currently has overcapacity, including in North Kalimantan.\par \par \uc2 Yanto further said that the land acquisition process which is near completion involves 50 hectares of land behind the village area. This area is meant for a new city. Meanwhile, only a few villagers whose land is destined for a new industrial area, Yanto said, have agreed to the company\u8217\'20\'19s offer of Rp50 million per hectare. \u8220\'20\'1CThere is still disagreement around the price,\u8221\'20\'1D said Yanto, adding that there is also \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  about relocation for the residents.\par \par \uc2 In the past three months, the KIHI project planning appeared to be muddled. In February, for example, the community heard about plans that heavy machinery would arrive on the project location. \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, nothing happened,\u8221\'20\'1D Yanto said. The latest rumor is that President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  will be visiting Mangkupadi in April. \u8220\'20\'1CWhy would those heavy machineries be there around the same time? It\u8217\'20\'19s confusing.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Nickel processing at the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park in Morowali, Central Sulawesi, August 2018. maritim.go.id\par \par \uc2 Iwan Sugiyanta, Bulungan Regency\u8217\'20\'19s Head of Regional Development Planning, said he heard the same information. \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s what I heard,\u8221\'20\'1D Iwan said when contacted on Saturday, March 26. \u8220\'20\'1CBut investors are better informed about development plans.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Land procurement and relocation plans for residents impacted by the project are not the only problems monitored by the local administration.

For example, she continued, Adaro will build an aluminum smelter in this zone to support the downstream industry. \u8220\'20\'1CAdaro hopes to take part in lowering aluminum imports, and give process and added value to aluminum, and increase government \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  receipts,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CAdaro also hopes that the presence of the aluminum industry in North Kalimantan will attract further investments and create jobs for the community.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 UNTIL now, \uc2 Adaro Energy\uc2  is better known as Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s second-biggest coal producer, just below Kaltim Prima Coal, part of the \uc2 Bumi Resources\uc2  business group.

Also, what about potential investors for KIHI\u8217\'20\'19s development, which is estimated to need investments totaling US$132 billion, or Rp1,887 trillion?\par \par \uc2 There are no clear answers for these questions yet, even though the government has insisted that many potential investors are interested in developing KIHI. A while ago, Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs \uc2 Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan\uc2  has said that interested parties include Australia\u8217\'20\'19s Fortescue Futures Industries Pty Ltd and China\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Tsingshan Holding Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Luhut also hinted that there are plans for investing in a petrochemical plant in KIHI. Without naming potential investors, Luhut said the petrochemical industry will come with an investment of US$56 billion, or Rp800 trillion. \u8220\'20\'1CWe will have the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest petrochemical (industry),\u8221\'20\'1D he said in the Grand Launching of Sustainable Project Investments in Jakarta on Thursday, March 17.\par \par \uc2 One week later, during the event Domestic Product \b \highlight22\uc2 Expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2  Business Matching at Nusa Dua, Bali, on Thursday, March 24, Luhut reiterated these plans. This time, Saudi Arabia was said to be interested in investing in KIHI. Luhut said he heard about these investment plans directly from Saudi Arabia Crown Prince \uc2 Mohammad bin Salman\uc2  when they met in Riyadh in early March.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 SINCE its inception, the concept of developing an industrial zone in North Kalimantan was meant to copy two previous projects: Asahan in North Sumatra and Morowali in Central Sulawesi. The Asahan Project, initiated by the Indonesian government and Japan in the 1970s, was deemed successful in integrating hydropower from the Asahan River and developing power users by setting up \uc2 Indonesia Asahan Aluminium\uc2  (\uc2 Inalum\uc2 ), currently better known as Mind Id.\par \par \uc2 A similar pattern was initially planned for the hydropower project at Mamberamo in the Sarmy Regency, Papua. This project, was initiated in 1995 by then Research and Technology Minister Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie,l who was also Head of the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT). Mamberamo River\u8217\'20\'19s potential hydropower was estimated at 24 gigawatts, bigger than all other rivers in North Kalimantan, which only reach 21.94 gigawatts. Before it was carried out, however, Suharto\u8217\'20\'19s New Order regime collapsed. Then, the Mamberamo hydropower project appeared in President Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Growth Acceleration and Expansion Master Plan. However, these plans also fell apart due to corruption scandals that landed Papua Governor Barnabas Suebu in jail.\par \par \uc2 BPPT researcher Agus Sugiono said that Habibie\u8217\'20\'19s initiative was not just meant to copy the Asahan Project, but also to set up another \uc2 Inalum\uc2  unit in Papua. The island\u8217\'20\'19s geographical position was seen as full of potential due to its proximity to Australia with its supply of bauxite, a basic material for producing aluminum. Also, Papua was closer to Japan, \uc2 Inalum\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s aluminum export market. \u8220\'20\'1CAt that time, there were no smelters and bauxite development in Kalimantan. So, the potential of Kayan and the other rivers in Kalimantan were not detected,\u8221\'20\'1D Agus said in his office at the Center for Research, Science and Technology (Puspiptek) in South Tangerang, Banten, on March 24.\par \par \uc2 Agus is the only researcher from the Memberamo hydropower plant (PLTA) who is still alive, out of the three experts that had studied that river. The initial Mamberamo PLTA feasibility study documents, Agus said, is still stored at the BPPT. After a long silence, the Mamberamo PLTA was mentioned again by President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  in November 2021 as a main priority in the development of renewable energy together with the Kayan PLTA. The concept remains that of power produced for a new industrial zone.\par \par \uc2 However, development in North Kalimantan went much faster. \uc2 Inalum\uc2  was even ahead in plans to develop aluminum clusters at the Tanah Kuning-Mangkupadi KIPI, an industrial zone of 10,000 hectares initiated by the regional government, by signing an Memorandum of Understanding with the North Kalimantan Provincial government in early June of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Inalum\uc2  is interested in making use of Kayan River\u8217\'20\'19s energy potential, which is estimated to reach 13 gigawatts, to illuminate its power-eating factory. Prior to signing the agreement, Irianto Lambrie, North Kalimantan\u8217\'20\'19s governor at that time, flew to North Sumatra to visit the Siguragura PLTA managed by \uc2 Inalum\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Morowali project was put forward as an example of a development done jointly with local residents. Zainal A. Paliwang, who became the next governor of North Kalimantan, planned to push the Tanah Kuning-Mangkupadi KIPI project, and visited the 2,000-hectare complex managed by Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park on September 9, 2021. There, Zainal saw how the industrial zone was built by a number of Chinese companies, from steam power plants stoked by coal to produce electricity, large ports for trade, to airports. Tsingshan Holding, which lately has been said to have interest in joining the KIHI project, is behind the Morowali Industrial Zone development.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Zainal was optimistic that the Tanah Kuning-Mangkupadi KIPI project, which was set to be part of North Kalimantan\u8217\'20\'19s spatial planning, would be carried out and inaugurated by President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2 . Also, the North Kalimantan administration has clinched 10 companies that are interested in developing the zone. The inauguration indeed happened, but the name Tanah Kuning-Mangkupadi KIPI project is nowhere to be found. What remains is the Indonesia Green Industrial Zone, a new branding needing much bigger land and deeper pockets for investment. Its realization remains a question mark.\par \par \uc2 AISHA SHAIDRA, KHAIRUL ANAM\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/03/27/797543/797543_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/03/27/797546/797546_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/03/27/797549/797549_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020220328ei3s00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: Nurturing growth in Indonesia's green  \highlight22\uc2 economy \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 1,171 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Rabin Hattari and Lenita Tobing, \uc2 Boston Consulting Group (BCG)\uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2  (BCG),\par \par \uc2 The world will need to achieve a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 to limit the worst impacts of climate change and mitigate a projected 25 percent loss to global GDP by 2100 if left unchecked.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 90 percent of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , including Indonesia, is now committed to a net-zero pathway. Our domestic progress is apparent, with an ambition to achieve net-zero by 2060 and national commitments for decarbonization and a just energy transition -- but there is undoubtedly more work to be done.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's road toward a green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  remains long and often unpaved, but our competitive advantages position us to emerge as green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  leaders.\par \par \uc2 Transforming Indonesia through the shaping of a green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , driven by the concept of a "just transition" provides us with significant opportunities to nurture new industries, create jobs and improve livelihoods, offering collective benefits that far outweigh the potential risks we face as we transition.\par \par \uc2 Building green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\par \par \uc2 A green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is low-carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive, whereby investments, employment and skill-building are incorporated into breakthrough changes in our overall \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems.\par \par \uc2 In green economies, short-term, one-off gestures are not the end goal. Rather than initiating one-time carbon offsets, resources should instead be focused toward building robust carbon credit ecosystems to drive the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  impact and job creation. Disruption to the existing \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  status quo in energy, transportation, agriculture and beyond, driven by long-term views on sustainable growth, are inevitable.\par \par \uc2 Countries such as the United Kingdom and India have set aside significant funding for renewable energy projects and green jobs development. Germany is reshaping its political governance through the formation of the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Affairs and Climate Action Ministry, a step toward more effective coordination at the federal and state level.\par \par \uc2 The pandemic also presented us with opportunities to implement green resilient recovery strategies. Pakistan offers a prime example, where thousands of idle laborers were retrained to help realize the nation's reforestation efforts.\par \par \uc2 These examples show the many ways Indonesia can integrate green growth strategies to build its green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but the key lies in embedding green initiatives into our competitive positioning.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's journey toward a strengthened green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  should leverage our existing natural advantages. We have promising renewable energy opportunities, especially in hydro and geothermal power generation, with most of this value yet to be realized.\par \par \uc2 Our abundant workforce also provides us with a labor capacity advantage, allowing Indonesia to rapidly scale up our green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , all while responding to challenges around availability of value-generating jobs.\par \par \uc2 It is projected that green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  investments could create up to ten times more jobs than comparative conventional investment in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Together, these natural advantages offer a chance for Indonesia to leapfrog its development beyond wasteful production and consumption patterns toward sustainable models, avoiding sunken capital and rigid structures seen in developed nations.\par \par \uc2 There are undoubtedly challenges in building Indonesia's green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Despite our massive potential, our renewable energy capacity and growth lags far behind those of our neighbors.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's lack of technological capabilities, such as those in solar panel manufacturing and carbon capture technology, has led to high costs and minimal commercialization of greener energies. This is exacerbated by a lack of private and international support due to frequent, ambiguous regulatory changes and an unfavorable coal pricing cap.\par \par \uc2 Developing technological, human and funding capabilities is vital, and must be supported by regulatory and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  structures positioned to ease the transition, overcome \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , alleviate burdensome bureaucracy and improve financial attractiveness to enable a track record of success.\par \par \uc2 Despite the challenges, Indonesia has shown encouraging signs of green growth. The government has issued carbon trading regulations to kick-start the establishment of carbon market mechanisms.\par \par \uc2 The initiation of the energy transition mechanism (ETM) partnerships strengthen our funding capabilities. Green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  pilot programs have also begun in Central and East Kalimantan to explore sustainable value generation initiatives, exemplifying the importance of tight integration between policies, plans and institutional frameworks in reform.\par \par \uc2 As one of the themes of our \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  presidency, sustainable energy transition is at the forefront of Indonesia's priorities. That includes phasing out coal power generation, with PLN halting the construction of new coal power plants by 2023, alongside \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 's accelerated focus on sustainable technologies such as biofuels, green refineries and the formation of their new and renewable energy sub-holding, Pertamina Power Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 These efforts signify Indonesia's commitment to energy transformations and offer an important alignment with the global direction, positioning Indonesia to drive competitive, green growth.\par \par \uc2 Future opportunities\par \par \uc2 An ecosystem of integrated and intersectional roles is needed to enable Indonesia's long-term green competitive advantages.\par \par \uc2 The government plays a pivotal role in catalyzing our green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  -- as capabilities are developed, regulatory support founded on a strong alignment between leaders and players will be key. Increased financial attractiveness, encouraged through the pioneering of green \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies and targeted financial programs, provides a level playing field for success.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Ministry\uc2  -- a shareholder in Indonesia's strategic SOEs -- have begun spearheading green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  developments in recent years, motivating SOEs to act as first movers and green growth champions, supporting nascent green industries while fulfilling their \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  service mandate.\par \par \uc2 The SOE ecosystem has instigated early efforts to pilot carbon trading mechanisms and nurture domestic green industry clusters, including developing an electric vehicle ecosystem through the establishment of the Indonesia Battery Corporation. These efforts mark a promising, pioneering step toward building Indonesia's green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , catalyzing the potential of ecosystem benefits and improving its capabilities.\par \par \uc2 It is imperative that active leadership by SOEs is supported by other stakeholders. Local governments, city/region-owned enterprises (BUMDs) and private players must work to optimize the wider community's efforts by incorporating green growth strategies into spatial planning and permit governance, reshaping internal budgeting practices and delivering insight and on-the-ground resources.\par \par \uc2 Realization of these efforts must be encouraged, facilitated and accelerated if we are to follow through with our commitment to building a green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the urgency of transformation and realizing our full green potential.\par \par \uc2 What next for Indonesia?\par \par \uc2 Indonesia is well positioned to build a vibrant green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but we must respond to identified challenges as well as align top-level goals with an effective on-the-ground strategy.\par \par \uc2 Our G20 presidency must catalyze Indonesia's 'just transition' toward a greener \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 --including ensuring energy access, affordable implementation and adequate financial support--such that we may lead by example and leave behind a shining, green legacy of our G20 presidency for years to come.\par \par \uc2 With the right frameworks and initiatives in place, Indonesia is set to enjoy a path toward an economically and environmentally sustainable future.\par \par \uc2 _____________________\par \par \uc2 Rabin Hattari is assistant minister for industry at the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry while Lenita Tobing is managing director and partner at \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220331ei3v00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Advertorial: Indonesia leads first G20 health meeting with discussion on global vaccine certificates\b0\par\par\uc2 1,295 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 At the first meeting of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  (G20) Health Working Group (HWG 1), which was held in a hybrid format from March 28 to 29 in Yogyakarta, the Health Ministry led discussions on setting a global standard for health protocols to promote safer and more convenient international travel. Indonesia not only called for the standardization of digital vaccine certificates but also technology sharing to develop a digital app that can be recognized across multiple countries for international travel.\par \par \uc2 HWG 1 chair Maxi Rein Rondonuwu, who is the director general for disease prevention and control at the Health Ministry, said that G20 members had responded positively to the Indonesian initiative, unanimously agreeing to align their health protocols under a global standard. They also agreed to establish digital COVID-19 vaccine certification that would be recognized by all participating countries.\par \par \uc2 "We need to standardize global health protocols to ensure safer international travel and to support \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and welfare recovery for good," said Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin at the opening ceremony of HWG 1.\par \par \uc2 The first step in developing a mutually recognized digital COVID-19 vaccine certificate was to set up a universal, online verification portal so countries could access the data of COVID-19 vaccine certificates. Specifically, the portal would read data on an individual's date of vaccination, type of vaccine and the number of doses they have received by scanning a quick response (QR) code. Countries linked within the system will be able to verify vaccination data with each other.\par \par \uc2 The Health Ministry had previously held bilateral talks with other governments and institutions that have developed digital health applications including Saudi Arabia, ASEAN and the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . From the discussions, they agreed to use QR codes as they can safely store information and respond quicker.\par \par \uc2 Since Indonesia has developed a universal certificate-verification portal according to \uc2 World Health Organization (WHO) \uc2 World Health Organization\uc2  (WHO) standards, other countries would not need to change their existing systems or QR codes. The portal is also designed for use on all devices.\par \par \uc2 "Before the G20, we trialed [the portal] with ASEAN countries. We will be testing the system further with G20 member countries," explained Maxi.\par \par \uc2 He added that the portal had been trialed so far in 20 member countries, with 19 countries reporting successfully integration with their existing systems. Only one country still needed to resolve a few technical issues.\par \par \uc2 Former WHO Southeast Asia director Tjandra Yoga Aditama suggested that the government conduct more trials and promote the technology at a bigger international forum for worldwide recognition and implementation.\par \par \uc2 "Its scope is still centered on G20 countries," Tjandra, who spoke at an HWG session, told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday. "Efforts still need to be made to bring this agreement to a higher level by means of a binding international document."\par \par \uc2 "The G20 is a group of 20 countries with the largest economies in the world. They're probably also the countries with the highest mobility rates. Starting with G20 is an advantageous move if we want this technology to be adopted by other countries," said Minister Budi.\par \par \uc2 "We want to promote the notion that standardizing global health protocols is simple and uniform around the world. We really want to take advantage of this existing technology," he added.\par \par \uc2 The Organization for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Co-operation and Development (\uc2 OECD\uc2 ), which is an active participant at high-level G20 meetings, said that mutual recognition of digital vaccine certificates was a safe solution for international travelers who struggled to have their vaccine certificates recognized by destination countries.\par \par \uc2 "[There are] billions of digital vaccination certificates. These certificates, however, have been issued in different formats which are not yet interoperable," said \uc2 OECD\uc2  global health advisor Nick Tomlinson, who attended a press briefing for the HWG meeting on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 OECD\uc2  has been working with the \uc2 WHO\uc2  to persuade non-G20 countries to adopt the \uc2 WHO\uc2 -approved digital format for COVID-19 vaccine certificates.\par \par \uc2 While Maxi felt that the first HWG meeting went smoothly, concerns remained among G20 leaders over several issues, including the security and privacy of personal vaccine data between countries.\par \par \uc2 "This system does not rely on data trade, so we can guarantee data safety as well as privacy. We built this technology using \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Key Infrastructure [PKI] that's been supported by G20 countries," said chief of the digital transformation office (DTO) Setiaji.\par \par \uc2 In its implementation, the universal verifier validates the vaccination data of international travelers upon entering or leaving a country. The universal verifier, with the permission of each county's authority, will provide information from the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  key infrastructure that can be verified by the interconnected portals.\par \par \uc2 The Health Ministry hopes that there will be a worldwide implementation of the universal verifier in preparation for a future outbreak or other disease mitigation.\par \par \uc2 The adoption of digital health applications and the availability of information technology (IT) infrastructure in lower- and middle-income countries also needs to be addressed. Civil groups have echoed the same concerns, calling on the G20 to ensure that the verification portal is accessible to people who struggle with accessing the internet or mobile phones.\par \par \uc2 "The HWG also needs to accommodate the conditions of people in poor and developing countries. If necessary, the G20 should also consider [investing] in developing [IT] resources in these countries," said Agung Pramono, coordinator of the G20 forum for civil society organizations (C20).\par \par \uc2 Despite their unanimous support for the digital vaccine certificate, G20 members have decided that proof of vaccination should not be required for international travel, considering the different vaccination rates across countries. They agreed that each country should have the authority to determine its requirements for international travel, including which vaccine product, type of COVID-19 test and testing authorities it recognizes.\par \par \uc2 "Countries are allowed to implement their own health protocols, but at least the process will be uniform when they open their borders for travel. The principle of our harmonization is respecting the sovereignty of all nations. We may not intervene," said the health minister.\par \par \uc2 The HWG aims to have the portal up and running before the G20 Summit in Bali in November.\par \par \uc2 Maxi said issues surrounding interoperability would be discussed at a follow-up meeting in April with the G20 Technical Working Group before implementing the universal verification portal for international travel across G20 countries.\par \par \uc2 By 2021, the governments of G20 countries had adopted a variety of COVID-19 measures, including health and safety guidelines, vaccine requirements and digital health information systems. According to the health minister, G20 leaders made a commitment to facilitate safe and disciplined international travel.\par \par \uc2 However, the ever-changing situation of the pandemic in each country had a significant impact on the formulation of COVID-19 rules and their implementation. The regulations in each country shift and develop according to localized conditions. The differing standards and systems for verifying COVID-19 test documents have only added to the confusion and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  among international travelers, often incurring additional travel costs.\par \par \uc2 Setting a standardized global health protocol would hopefully create ease in mobility for international travelers, said Maxi, adding that this would in turn also help revive global tourism, which had been severely affected by mobility curbs and border restrictions. According to global data, there was a decrease in tourism of 73 percent in 2020 and 72 percent in 2021 compared with 2019.\par \par \uc2 Minister Budi also stated that the harmonization of global health protocol standards and equalization of digital vaccine certificates was one of the core issues within the G20 HWG.\par \par \uc2 "The discussion [on digital vaccine certificates] will be pivotal in ensuring that transportation and the global supply chain runs smoothly, while also accelerating global recovery," he said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220331ei3v00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Subsidized diesel shortage hits freight haulage industry\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 901 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 A subsidized diesel shortage has disrupted trucking operations in many parts of Indonesia, as recovering domestic fuel demand meets rising global oil prices.\par \par \uc2 Local news outlets have reported long lines of trucks at fueling stations operated by state-owned oil giant \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  across the archipelago, with drivers saying they have had to wait for up to 24 hours for the diesel fuel commonly known as "solar". Trucking associations say the problem is particularly acute in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian Truck Operators Association (Aptrindo) said on Tuesday that the supply crunch meant drivers either waited longer to refuel or got less fuel than needed, forcing them to refuel more often than usual, causing delays.\par \par \uc2 Aptrindo deputy chairman Kyatmaja Lookman said that this month was critical for delivering goods ahead of the expected Ramadan and Idul Fitri consumption spike. The fasting month begins this year in April.\par \par \uc2 "It is almost Lebaran, and in less than a month trucks will be limited due to mudik [exodus]. If the government added to the [subsidized diesel] quota, there would be no queue," said Aptrindo deputy chairman Kyatmaja Lookman on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Trucks, which are the main users of the nation's subsidized diesel, form the backbone of the domestic freight industry. Road transportation accounts for 70 to 80 percent of the freight volume moved in the country, according to Mordor Intelligence data cited by the \uc2 Organization for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Cooperation and Development\uc2  (\uc2 OECD\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Regulations state that subsidized diesel may be used in buses, trains, certain ships and private and commercial trucks, except those with more than six wheels carrying mining or palm oil goods.\par \par \uc2 Indonesian Logistics Association (ALI) chairman Mahendra Rianto said on Thursday that the fuel crunch had disrupted domestic supply chains as goods were taking longer to reach local distributors.\par \par \uc2 "In \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  law, if the supply chain is disrupted, there will be scarcity, which could lead to a surge in prices," said Mahendra.\par \par \uc2 Such a surge would add to the already high prices of staple goods and would further erode consumer purchasing power, which had been negatively affected by the pandemic, he added.\par \par \uc2 Behind the shortage\par \par \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  -- the top distributor of subsidized diesel -- blamed the supply crunch on a combination of soaring fuel demand amid the ongoing \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery from the pandemic, the lowering of the subsidized diesel quota by 5 percent from last year and trucks owners' unwillingness to buy unsubsidized diesel as oil prices rose.\par \par \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  CEO \uc2 Nicke Widyawati\uc2  said on Monday that many trucks that were ineligible for the \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2 , such as those carrying freight for large palm oil or mining companies, were using subsidized fuel nonetheless to limit costs amid high oil prices.\par \par \uc2 "This has led to a shift in consumption, causing the \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to miss its actual target," Nicke told lawmakers during a meeting with \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  Commission VI overseeing state-owned enterprises (SOEs), trade and investment.\par \par \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  noted that demand for subsidized diesel had exceeded the daily quota by more than 10 percent since March. The company expected the full-year demand to reach 16 million kiloliters, 14 percent higher than the quota, signaling impending scarcity.\par \par \uc2 Nicke called on lawmakers to raise the subsidized diesel quota for the year and said the company would continue supplying the fuel.\par \par \uc2 Subsidized fuels make up nearly 83 percent of annual fuel consumption in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Nicke went on to say that soaring oil prices had caused a significant price gap of Rp 7,800 (54 US cents) per liter between subsidized and unsubsidized fuel.\par \par \uc2 The company suggested that the government switch to a direct \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  scheme, whereby fuel allowances were given directly to low-income households, instead of to companies. The government has yet to implement such a scheme due to poor data collection and organization.\par \par \uc2 Alfian Nasution, CEO of fuel distribution subsidiary Pertamina Patra Niaga, blamed the shortage on the ambiguous eligibility requirements for subsidized fuel.\par \par \uc2 The company is in talks with the Downstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency (BPH Migas) to set more detailed regulations.\par \par \uc2 "The rules now are far too macro. They only mention palm oil and mining trucks. BPH Migas has actually drafted a more detailed definition," Alfian told lawmakers on Monday.\par \par \uc2 I Ketut Gede Aryawan, head of fuel distribution at BPH Migas, told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday that the agency had reviewed rules on fuel distribution. They were now in the process of providing more detail for some provisions, including who was eligible to purchase subsidized diesel.\par \par \uc2 "We hope that these two arrangements can control the consumption of subsidized diesel," Ketut said.\par \par \uc2 Impending \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\par \par \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 's Nicke said the company was suffering huge upfront losses from the price gap. For a price difference of Rp 7,800 per liter, \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  only receives Rp 500 per liter in government \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  under the current state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The government is obligated to compensate \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  for the remaining price difference, but these compensations are only disbursed after the financial year ends.\par \par \uc2 "The rest will be [paid for with government] compensation, but it contains \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  still needs to use its own funds, which will affect its cash flow," Nicke said.\par \par \uc2 Faisol Riza, who chairs House Commission VI, criticized \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  over the long waits for subsidized fuel, claiming that lawmakers had warned the company but that it had still failed to prepare for the problem.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220331ei3v0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: The dilemma of rising gasoline prices\b0\par\par\uc2 976 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Ahmad Zuhdi Dwi Kusuma, Mandiri, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Commodity prices have been very volatile since the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery from COVID-19. Several worldwide events have pushed commodity prices to exceed their pre-pandemic levels, such as supply chain disruption and the energy crisis. However, in early 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine occurred, adding more upside risk to commodity prices.\par \par \uc2 In a nutshell, the invasion has generated substantial \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  regarding commodities supply, which then led to even higher prices. Just a few weeks after the invasion started, the world saw the price of some commodities, including crude oil, soar unimaginably high.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the crude oil price surged to its highest level in the last decade at US$128 per barrel, before falling to around $100 per barrel after some oil-producing countries committed to increasing production. For Indonesia, the surge in the oil price will indeed have a negative impact due to Indonesia's well-known status as a net importer of oil. However, there is also the positive impact of the increasing oil price for Indonesia through an increase in state revenue.\par \par \uc2 According to the 2022 state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 , every $1 increase in the oil price will potentially increase the state revenue by roughly Rp 3 trillion ($69 million). The increase is expected to come from oil and gas \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  and nontax state income from natural resources.\par \par \uc2 By using our forecast of the 2022 average oil price -- at $119.8 per barrel (up by $49 per barrel compared with 2021's average $70.8 per barrel) where the Russia-Ukraine war is predicted to last for six months -- we should expect that state revenue will rise to at least Rp 147 trillion.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, higher fuel prices as a result of the price surge could harm Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last week, Indonesia's major fuel supplier \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  finally increased the price of Pertamax (RON 92) by 39 percent, to Rp 12,500 per liter from Rp 9,000. The decision is widely seen as a bold move since the consumption of RON 92 accounts for around 6.2 billion liters, or 10 percent of total fuel consumption.\par \par \uc2 However, we believe that \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 's decision to increase the Pertamax price is not without reason.\par \par \uc2 First, the nature of Pertamax, which is stated in Presidential Decree No. 191/2014 on gasoline fuel. Thus, the price of Pertamax should move in line with the global crude oil (Brent) price.\par \par \uc2 Second, the gap between the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and retail prices of Pertamax, which has widened since the end of 2021.\par \par \uc2 Our calculation, based on Energy and Mineral Resources Ministerial Decree No. 20/2021 and No. 62/2020, shows that with the average price of crude oil at $77.8 per barrel in December 2021 the gap between the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the retail prices of Pertamax is around Rp 3,133 per liter.\par \par \uc2 The gap got wider to around Rp 6,942 per liter, considering the average price of crude oil at $112.5 per barrel in March 2022. Even after the 39 percent increase in the Pertamax price, the gap is still slightly higher than in December 2021.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the government maintains the prices of Pertalite (RON 90) and Premium (RON 88) unchanged despite the increase in the Pertamax price.\par \par \uc2 However, to keep the Pertalite price unchanged, we observe that the potential indirect burden for the government through the compensation given to \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  will be at the very least around Rp 206.6 trillion, assuming the 2022 average oil price is $119.9 per barrel.\par \par \uc2 Even with the potential increase in state revenue by Rp 147 trillion, the government still has to make up around Rp 59 trillion. This means more pressure on \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  capacity as the government's existing debt to \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  amounts to Rp 84.4 trillion. On the other hand, we should expect an increase in the Pertalite price if the government passes the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  burden onto consumers.\par \par \uc2 Our calculation shows that for every Rp 1,000 per liter increase in the Pertalite price, the compensation burden in 2022 will decline by Rp 23.1 trillion. Or, in our \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 -neutral scenario, the Pertalite price should increase to Rp 10,200 to completely eliminate the additional compensation burden assuming there is no demand shift from Pertamax to Pertalite.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, increasing the price of gasoline is not a perfect coping mechanism at a time of high oil prices though it potentially lessens the financial pressure for the government and \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 . We expect there will be some drawbacks to increasing the gasoline price.\par \par \uc2 First, in the case of Pertamax, consumers may shift to the cheaper but lower quality fuel Pertalite, leading to shortages of Pertalite and exceeding the quota allocated by the government.\par \par \uc2 Second, the higher Pertamax price will increase inflationary pressure. We expect the 39 percent increase in the Pertamax price to result in a 0.2-point increase in inflation.\par \par \uc2 However, it is not the worst case. We should be watchful for increasing inflation if the rising Pertamax price triggers an increase in the Pertalite price.\par \par \uc2 A higher Pertalite price will have a larger impact on inflation as Pertalite accounts for around 48 percent of total gasoline consumption. Our calculation shows that inflation will increase by 0.32 points for every 10 percent increase in the Pertalite price.\par \par \uc2 We understand that it will not be a painless call for the government to finally adjust gasoline prices as there will be huge pressure on the Indonesia \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 However, we believe that the government should ensure that the price adjustment of oil-related products, including Pertalite and LPG, will be carried out gradually.\par \par \uc2 Thus, consumers will have more time to adjust to rising prices, which then eases inflationary pressure.\par \par \uc2 _______________________\par \par \uc2 Industry and regional analyst at the \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  chief economist's office\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220405ei450000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Indonesia at a crossroads in pursuing long-time spaceport dream\b0\par\par\uc2 989 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Ridha Aditya Nugraha and Taufik Rachmat Nugraha , Jakarta/Bandung\par \par \uc2 Tensions between the West and Russia have escalated to a critical level in outer space. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to numerous sanctions against the aggressor, including one on national space agency Rocosmos and private aerospace companies.\par \par \uc2 Sanctions against Russia's aerospace industry have increased existing tensions and lead to reinstating bipolarity in space activities, as happened during the Cold War space race.\par \par \uc2 Such bipolarity will more or less affect Indonesia's space activities also, either directly or indirectly, particularly its plan to build a spaceport in Biak, Papua.\par \par \uc2 As an equatorial country, Indonesia is aware of its highly strategic location in facilitating space activities. One of its most important strategies is launching a program to promote Indonesia as a newly emerging space power: a game changer that will also bring \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  benefits.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia has dreamed of building a spaceport since 1963, but due to the political turmoils of 1965 and 1998, the plan remained excluded from national \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  until 2013, when the government enacted Law No. 21/2013 on Space Activities.\par \par \uc2 The 2013 Space Law sets legal grounds to begin planning long-term Indonesian space activities. This includes developing a national spaceport in Indonesian territory. The mandate has been reinforced in the 2016-2040 Space Industry Development Master Plan, with phased targets for building the spaceport.\par \par \uc2 Currently, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (Lapan) is drafting a \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on spaceport operation and space commercialization.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's spaceport will likely have the capability to launch a dual-stage rocket carrying low earth orbit (LEO) satellites by 2040. The spaceport is to be for both government and private launches. It is ideal for Indonesia, considering its vast sea territory, not to mention its location near the equator.\par \par \uc2 In 2002, Russia expressed its interest in building an "air launch system" in Biak, followed by signing an agreement in 2006. Russian interests include a strategy to build confidence and strengthen its presence in space technology in Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia in particular. No recent discussions have been held between Indonesia and Russia to realize the plan.\par \par \uc2 The major constraint of Indonesia-Russia space cooperation is the fact Indonesia is not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The multilateral regime limits its member states in exporting and sharing sensitive space technology to nonmember states. As a result, the Indonesia-Russia space partnership will face difficulties in sharing knowledge of sensitive space technology.\par \par \uc2 This hampers importing rocket technology from Russia. According to the MTCR, rocket technology falls under the dual-use doctrine on technologies for both civilian and military purposes, with the latter covering explosive warhead payloads for aggressive or defensive purposes.\par \par \uc2 One way to break the stalemate is for Indonesia to apply for MTCR membership. Once Indonesia is admitted, other member states can provide it with direct access to space technology to support the future development of an Indonesian spaceport.\par \par \uc2 One requirement for MTCR membership is that the applicant country has enacted a \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on the transfer of sensitive technologies. The legal basis is provisioned in Article 27 of Indonesia's 2013 Space Law, which indicates its intention to meet international standards on transferring sensitive technologies.\par \par \uc2 However, further details on implementing this provision are pending completion of a government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now, the Russia-Ukraine war may jeopardize Indonesia's spaceport dream, which is why it should consider an alternative partner or partners.\par \par \uc2 Amid the current geopolitical \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Indonesia should determine the direction of its space development. It has turned to its free and active foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  stance when it refused to impose sanctions against Russia, although it did vote to support the United Nations resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 However, in the long run, Indonesia's free and active \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  stance shall become a major constraint in pursuing "\uc2 Space 4.0\uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 Outer space activities have become more polarized as regards the technologies developed by Russia and the United States. Indonesia's foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  stance needs reformulating to distinguish activities on earth and in outer space.\par \par \uc2 Times have changed and the Cold War showed that Soviet Union-US tensions on earth did not spill over into outer space. The \uc2 UN\uc2 's Outer Space Treaty to maintain peace in the space beyond earth has remained triumphant and should be maintained.\par \par \uc2 Redefining Indonesia's foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  stance, particularly in relation to outer space activities, will give the country more choices and opportunities in developing its space capabilities.\par \par \uc2 Had its foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  stance been reformulated, Indonesia have no need to fear any sanctions on entering an agreement with Russia on space activities, while it could continue to be engaged with western technologies.\par \par \uc2 Good Indonesian-Russian ties in space activities is capital for Indonesia to master space technology. Space debris has become a more serious issue, while dialogue between the two countries could lead to efforts to half the development of anti-satellite weapons (ASATs). Russia has been actively conducting ASAT tests since 2020.\par \par \uc2 Space activities are seen as high-risk, high-tech and expensive, which is why only a few developed countries possess the necessary technologies to pursue them effectively.\par \par \uc2 Until today, Russia and the US are regarded as the pioneers of space exploration and activities.\par \par \uc2 Compared to other sectors, the space industry is unique and extraordinary in that any country seeking to develop its capacity in space technology must choose between Russia and the US. Each choice comes with a price, including for Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 However, redefining its free and active foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  doctrine with a purpose to maintain peace on earth and in outer space could lower the price.\par \par \uc2 _________________\par \par \uc2 Ridha Aditya Nugraha teaches air and space law at Prasetiya Mulya University.

The government has begun transferring cash to around 20.7 million families around Indonesia, weeks ahead of the Islamic holiday of Idul Fitri, to help them afford cooking oil, which had doubled in price in the past few months.\par \par \uc2 The cooking oil direct cash assistance (BLT) program would pay each family Rp 300,000 ($21), supposedly covering three months' worth of their cooking oil expense. The government has earmarked Rp 6.9 trillion for the program, taken out from year's Rp 455.6 trillion Covid-19 relief \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  has instructed his aides to complete the cash transfer before Idul Fitri, which falls on May 1.\par \par \uc2 "According to the president's instruction, the cooking oil BLT must be distributed during Ramadan. Even, it must finish one week before Idul Fitri," Susiwijono, the Coordinating Ministry for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Affairs secretary, said on Friday.\par \par \uc2 "This cooking oil BLT is part of the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery program, or PEN, and uses the 2022 PEN \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Susiwijono said.\par \par \uc2 Among the recipients were 18.8 million families currently registered under the government's non-cash transfer food assistance (BPNT) program and an additional 1.85 million families registered under Family Hope, a conditional cash transfer program, but not in BNPT. The government earmarked Rp 6.19 trillion for them, Susiwijono said.\par \par \uc2 Also, there would be an additional Rp 750 billion cash transfer for 2.5 million street vendors, food-stall owners, and fishers, Susiwijono said.\par \par \uc2 He said the Ministry of Social Affairs would organize the disbursements for food assistance recipients. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the National Police would manage the distribution of cash transfers for the street vendors, food-stall owners, and fishers.\par \par \uc2 Isa Rachmatarwata, the director-general of the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  at the Ministry of Finance, said the cooking oil direct cash assistance was not intended to control inflation. Instead, it was a response to the inflation, which rose to its highest level in more than two years last month.\par \par \uc2 "We are trying to respond appropriately," Isa said, adding that the government may extend the program in July.\par \par \uc2 "Many things are \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2 . We may need to respond with an extension, or maybe it is enough for just three months," Isa said.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Indonesia's annual inflation reached 2.64 percent, the highest since December 2019 and accelerating from 2.06 percent in February. The Central Statistics Agency noted spiking cooking oil prices were the main driver for the acceleration.\par \par \uc2 A liter of cooking oil fetched around Rp 23,800 today, 76 percent higher than Rp 13,500 a year ago, in line with the global crude palm oil price increase.\par \par \uc2 The government's previous intervention by setting a ceiling price for cooking oil backfired, with supplies disappearing from the market. So, last month it revoked the price cap, and the cooking oil returned to the store shelves overnight, albeit at a higher price.\par \par \uc2 Chatib Basri, an economist from the University of Indonesia, said earlier that the government made the right decision to let the market determine cooking oil prices and subsidized the poor with cash transfers to ease the price increase impact on their livelihood.\par \par \uc2 "Price control won't work anywhere. That is the first lesson of economics, never control the price. If the price is set below the production cost, the goods will disappear," Chatib said.\par \par \uc2 "So, the government's steps are correct. Let prices follow the market and then provide the BLT," he said.\par \par \uc2 Document JGLOBE0020220409ei4900001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Parties row back on poll delay proposal\b0\par\par\uc2 Dio Suhenda and Nur Janti, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 903 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Parties that had previously supported delaying the 2024 elections have made a complete U-turn to support President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2 's decision to go ahead with the elections as scheduled.\par \par \uc2 Several prominent coalition members had proposed the election postponement and the extension of Jokowi's term beyond 2024 -- changes that would require a constitutional amendment. The parties in support of the postponement included the Golkar Party, the National Awakening Party (PKB) and the National Mandate Party (PAN).\par \par \uc2 However, the Golkar leadership issued a statement on Monday supporting Jokowi's decision.\par \par \uc2 Golkar deputy chair Nurul Arifin said the party fully endorsed the government's decision to hold the general election on Feb. 14, 2024.\par \par \uc2 Nurul also claimed that Golkar had been consistent in pushing for the President to step down when his second and final term ended in 2024, saying that party chairman \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2 's call for Jokowi's term to be extended was a reflection of voters' aspirations.\par \par \uc2 "Such a proposal was never the official position of the party. We never called for an extended term or to postpone the elections," Nurul said.\par \par \uc2 Back in February, along with politicians from PAN and the PKB, Airlangga called for delaying the 2024 elections to allow Jokowi to serve beyond his final five-year term.\par \par \uc2 Airlangga, who is also the coordinating \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  minister, was in a limited Cabinet meeting on Sunday where President Jokowi told his aides that the general election would be held as scheduled, ending speculation that his government was trying to delay the polls and extend his term.\par \par \uc2 Also at Sunday's meeting were Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Mahfud MD, Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister \uc2 Luhut Pandjaitan\uc2  and Home Minister Tito Karnavian.\par \par \uc2 PAN deputy chairman Yandri Susanto also said on Monday that the option of extending Jokowi's term was no longer available.\par \par \uc2 "Jokowi's statement closes the chance of extending or increasing the president's term," Yandri told reporters at the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  complex.\par \par \uc2 "We of course very much agree that there shouldn't be any more discourse on election delays or term extensions. [PAN] is going to focus on 2024."\par \par \uc2 PAN chairman Zulkifli Hasan was the second political leader to float the idea for the delay in February. Zulkifli even outlined five reasons why the elections should be postponed; one of them being the global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  caused by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which he said would disrupt the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , including that of Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 PKB chairman Muhaimin Iskandar was the first political bigwig to make the election-postponement call, saying that the elections should be delayed by one or two years so that they would not "disrupt \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery" following the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 In March, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the party with the most seats in the House, and of which President Jokowi is a member, strongly rejected these proposals.\par \par \uc2 Students rally\par \par \uc2 Jokowi's statement came a day before planned student rallies on Monday in Jakarta and in several other cities protesting against proposals to extend his final term in office beyond its constitutionally mandated limit.\par \par \uc2 The rally in Jakarta was called by the National Association of University Student Executive Bodies (BEM SI). It was initially staged in front of the State Palace in Central Jakarta before moving to the House complex on Jl. Gatot Subroto.\par \par \uc2 BEM SI spokesperson Luthfi Yufrizal said on Monday that the group wanted to focus its efforts on demanding that lawmakers refrain from amending the Constitution -- which would be necessary if Jokowi's term was to be extended -- and to firmly reject any proposal to extend the President's term.\par \par \uc2 Students started gathering in front of the House complex at around 2 p.m. A few hours into the demonstration, House Deputy Speaker and Gerindra Party politician Sufmi Dasco Ahmad answered the students' call for an audience with lawmakers. He was accompanied by fellow deputy speakers Lodewijk Paulus of Golkar and Rachmat Gobel of the NasDem, as well as National Police chief Gen. \uc2 Listyo Sigit Prabowo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Speaking in front of hundreds of protesters, Sufmi said the House agreed with the student's demands and would continue preparations to hold the presidential election as scheduled.\par \par \uc2 A majority of students then disbanded following Sufmi's comments, but some groups started to hurl stones into the complex. This prompted police to use tear gas and water cannon to disperse the demonstrators.\par \par \uc2 During the rally, University of Indonesia lecturer Ade Armando was attacked by several protesters; it was not immediately clear what prompted the attack. Videos on social media showed Ade with a bloodied face being escorted by police personnel into the House complex.\par \par \uc2 Monday's rally in Jakarta was expected to be much larger than a string of student-led protests that have been held across the country, including in Bogor in West Java, Makassar in South Sulawesi and Semarang in Central Java in the past week.\par \par \uc2 Jakarta Police deployed 6,000 personnel to safeguard the rally and redirected traffic on several roads in anticipation.\par \par \uc2 Police personnel in Jakarta's satellite cities were also posted at train stations, bus terminals and main roads to Jakarta to prevent students from joining their peers in the capital.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, student rallies were staged in cities including Bandung, Semarang, Palu and Palembang.

\par\par \b \uc2 GoTo gains 23% on IDX debut as tech hype cools\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 907 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Homegrown tech giant GoTo gained 23 percent at its \uc2 Indonesia Stock Exchange\uc2  (IDX) debut on Monday, a smaller gain compared with competitor Bukalapak, following a global cooldown of investor appetite for tech stocks.\par \par \uc2 GoTo, a merger between ride-hailing firm Gojek and e-marketplace Tokopedia, saw share prices rise to Rp 416 (2.8 US cents) apiece during the first hour of trading, from the initial \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  offering (IPO) price of Rp 338 apiece. Listed under the ticker GOTO, the company is the first tech decacorn to be publicly listed in Southeast Asia.\par \par \uc2 However, GoTo's gains were lower than homegrown e-marketplace unicorn Bukalapak -- the first tech giant to go \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the region -- that posted a 25 percent gain during its IDX debut on Aug. 6 last year, even though the former is 15 times larger than the latter in terms of market cap.\par \par \uc2 The decacorn went \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  at a time when companies were delaying IPOs amid market volatility due to the Ukraine war and rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and as investors were letting go of stocks of tech firms including Bukalapak, Grab and SEA Group -- owner of e-marketplace Shopee.\par \par \uc2 "There was no perfect timing for this IPO, but our focus was on Indonesia, with a local investor audience. Despite \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the market, Indonesia has performed much better than other countries," GoTo CEO \uc2 Andre Soelistyo\uc2  told reporters in Jakarta.\par \par \uc2 He said the company would focus on improving its business performance and share prices would adjust accordingly.\par \par \uc2 GoTo shares closed at Rp 382 apiece on Monday, just 13 percent higher than the IPO price.\par \par \uc2 GoTo, which is the 15th company listed on IDX this year, brought Rp 400 trillion in fresh market cap to Indonesia's stock market, raising the bourse total to Rp 9.4 quadrillion.\par \par \uc2 Following the IPO, the decacorn became the fourth largest publicly listed company on the IDX by market cap after private lender BCA, state-owned lender BRI and state-owned telecommunications firm PT Telkom Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 GoTo raised Rp 13.72 trillion in fresh capital through the IPO with GoTo and e-commerce arm Tokopedia slated to get 30 percent each, e-wallet GoPay 25 percent, multifinance arm PT Multifinance Anak Bangsa (MAB) 5 percent and business arms in Singapore and Vietnam 10 percent each.\par \par \uc2 "The IDX hopes the listed company could soon realize its strategic plan with the fund it gathered, while remaining transparent and accountable to the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," IDX assessment director I Gede Nyoman Yetna said during GoTo's IPO ceremony on Monday.\par \par \uc2 He reminded the company to maintain the performance of its financial fundamentals after the IPO.\par \par \uc2 Analysts have raised concerns over GoTo's ability to deliver returns as the tech giant was expected to continue posting net losses until 2024. The company booked GoTo posted a loss of Rp 7.59 trillion as of July 2021, according to its prospectus.\par \par \uc2 GoTo carried out its IPO plan as global investors' appetite for tech stocks was reaching record lows. Grab saw its shares fall to $3.16 apiece on Sunday, a 75 percent drop since going \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 , while SEA fell by more than 68 percent to $114.42 apiece on Sunday since its peak in October last year.\par \par \uc2 Bukalapak also saw its price drop to Rp 334 apiece as of Monday, down by 60 percent since its first trading day in IDX.\par \par \uc2 Andre said the company had yet to decide on its dual listing plan on an overseas capital market because it was still observing market conditions.\par \par \uc2 Despite the stormy days for tech stocks, GoTo shares were oversubscribed by 15.7 times during the offering period, almost double the oversubscription for Bukalapak shares at 8.7 times.\par \par \uc2 Following the GoTo IPO, the IDX Composite Index, the main gauge of the local bourse, hit an all-time high at around 7,355 during the first trading session, up by more than 200 points from the previous trading day, before closing at around 7,239.\par \par \uc2 In comparison, the IDX Composite Index closed at 6,203 after BUKA's IPO, down from 6,205 a day prior.\par \par \uc2 Mirae Asset Securities analyst M. Nafan Aji Gusta said on Monday that market euphoria had driven GoTo's share price upward, albeit not as much as it did for Bukalapak, as investors, especially Indonesian retail investors, have been more accustomed to having listed start-ups in the market.\par \par \uc2 Global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2 's monetary tightening also spurred investors, particularly foreign investors, to avoid high-risk assets like stocks.\par \par \uc2 "But this is good because a steady increase will make the stock's performance steady as well. If it rises too much, such as if it hits the upper auto rejection limit, then it could soon hit the lower auto rejection limit as well," Nafan told The Jakarta Post.\par \par \uc2 A rapid rise in share prices would likely trigger profit-taking, which would cause prices to fall afterward, he added.\par \par \uc2 Paulus Jimmy, an equity research analyst at Sucor Sekuritas, said on Monday that the strong foreign capital inflows to the Indonesia market would continue supporting GoTo's share prices, albeit only in the short term.\par \par \uc2 "It is best to wait until there was a little correction [on GoTo share prices] to make an entry," Paulus told the Post.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220411ei4b00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Finance Minister Sri \uc2 Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  said Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  remained strong amid the escalating war between Russia and Ukraine. In early March 2022, various indicators showed that the domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  started to recover with maintained levels of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  consumption, investment, government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as well as exports, and imports.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CExport performance has moved significantly, but we must stay vigilant about trade developments and global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth which are threatened by the war between Russia and Ukraine. However, a number of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  indicators until early March were good,\u8221\'20\'1D Sri said at a press conference on Wednesday, April 13.\par \par \uc2 According to the minister, the rupiah exchange rate against the dollar was also maintained amidst increasing \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in global financial markets. Although it recorded a depreciation of 0.33 percent in Q1 of 2022 (year to date), this was considered better than the position at the end of 2021.\par \par \uc2 Besides, the rupiah depreciation was even lower than the currencies of other developing countries. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Malaysian ringgit experienced a 1.15 percent depreciation year to date, India at 1.73 percent year to date, Thailand at 3.15 percent year to date,\u8221\'20\'1D outlined the former managing director of the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She also said the inflation was still under control at 2.64 percent year on year, supported by the controlled supply and the government's efforts to stabilize the prices of goods.\par \par \uc2 Though \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  indicators show improvement, Sri Mulyani said Indonesia must calculate the risk of the impact of the global turmoil that affects global inflation, world \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance, and cost of funds. \u8220\'20\'1CKSSK (the Financial System Stability Committee) continues to monitor the financial tension and system stability to maintain it,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 Read: Sri Mulyani: Increased Prices of Goods New Challenge for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\par \par \uc2 FRANCISCA CHRISTY ROSANA\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/02/17/id_1088745/1088745_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020220413ei4d0008g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Finance Minister, concurrently Chair of the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK), Sri \uc2 Mulyani Indrawati\uc2 , stated that global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery was stalled due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 "Improvement in the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  itself will be lower than the previous projections," the minister noted at the KSSK Press Conference here on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Sri Mulyani explained that improvement in the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will be lower as compared to the earlier projections accompanied by increased financial market volatility in line with the escalation of the war between the two countries.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, positive expectations for the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery in line with the easing of COVID-19 became restrained or came under pressure due to escalation of the war in Ukraine since February 24, 2022.\par \par \uc2 The imposition of sanctions by the United States, Europe, and \uc2 G7\uc2  countries against Russia in the midst of ongoing supply chain disruptions had also depressed the trade volume and prospects for global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 The war also triggered a very significant increase in global commodity prices, especially energy, food, and metal commodities and resulted in an increase in global inflation.\par \par \uc2 The war between Russia and Ukraine also creates challenges for the normalization of the monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in developed countries that then raises \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in global financial markets.\par \par \uc2 Capital flows in emerging markets were also depressed due to the monetary policies of developed countries in response to the surge in inflation, which at the same time was still facing the potential for an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  downturn.\par \par \uc2 "This is in line with the asset reallocation step to find a safe haven asset," she stated.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Sri Mulyani emphasized that the stability of the Indonesian financial system was still normal, indicated by stable \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery, especially supported by the better handling of COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 The decline in cases and good handling of COVID-19, followed by the easing of restrictions on community activities, in the end further encouraged domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activities.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is also forecast to remain strong, supported by \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  or household consumption activities, investment activities, and support for government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 However, Sri Mulyani did not deny that there were several other risks from global conditions that would likely affect inflation, cost of funds, and domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance.\par \par \uc2 Hence, the KSSK will continue to strengthen coordination, including in formulating \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  responses that are coordinated and synergized in maintaining national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery from global turmoil and dynamics.\par \par \uc2 "The KSSK remains vigilant and monitors financial system stability in order to maintain it," the minister noted.\par \par \uc2 (T.K012/A/S022/S022) 13-04-2022 15:56:10\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220413ei4d000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Ukraine crisis hits Indonesian cement, fertilizer industries\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 806 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Russia's invasion of Ukraine has affected Indonesian cement and fertilizer producers with many firms in the two industries, which are among the bellwethers of the construction and agriculture sectors, facing difficulty securing certain raw materials.\par \par \uc2 State-owned cement producer PT Semen Indonesia Group (\uc2 SIG\uc2 ) and state-owned fertilizer producer \uc2 PT Pupuk Indonesia\uc2 , the top companies in their respective industries, told lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday that the industries were facing difficulty securing coal, kraft paper and a certain chemical used to make fertilizer due to the Ukraine war.\par \par \uc2 SIG\uc2  CEO Donny Arsal said surging international coal prices meant coal miners preferred to export the commodity instead of selling it at domestic market obligation (DMO) prices. Thus, many cement producers were struggling to get hold of the fuel.\par \par \uc2 Indonesian benchmark coal prices (HBA) have surged to US$288.40 per ton in April after Western countries embargoed Russian coal. In comparison, the DMO \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  pegs prices at $70 per ton. Most DMO coal goes to the electricity industry.\par \par \uc2 "The rest of the coal sold at DMO price [left after electricity demand] is up for grabs for cement, smelter and other players. If the supply is not enough, then some players might not get coal at DMO prices," Donny told lawmakers of \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  Commission VII, which oversees industry and energy.\par \par \uc2 He urged the government to make a clear who-supplies-whom \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to ensure stability in the cement industry.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia currently has around 160 million tons of coal sold at DMO prices with state-owned electricity company PLN taking more than 76 percent of the total, leaving around 30 million tons for industries like cement and metal refining, among other industries.\par \par \uc2 In total, the cement industry needs 16 million tons, which is more than half of the leftover from PLN demand. PT SIG, which holds a 50 percent share of the domestic cement market, needed around 7.5 million tons.\par \par \uc2 Following the supply crunch, \uc2 SIG\uc2  acquired roughly 63 percent of its total coal needs at DMO prices, while the rest was left \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as few miners were willing to sell at DMO prices. Company \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was to prioritize buying coal at DMO prices, instead of at market prices.\par \par \uc2 "If we cannot secure [the rest of the supply], it could affect our business. But we will not say that we can't get suppliers. We will try first," Donny said.\par \par \uc2 Aside from the coal supply shortage, the war in Ukraine has deprived \uc2 SIG\uc2  of kraft -- a raw material required to produce cement bags. Most kraft used by \uc2 SIG\uc2  was sourced from Russia, which has stopped supplying the material since the war began.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia once produced kraft in Aceh province, but the producer has long closed its business. Since then, \uc2 SIG\uc2  has been sourcing the material from imports, which costs the company around Rp 960 billion ($66.82 million) annually.\par \par \uc2 "The supply was stopped due to the war. Now we are switching to a woven material, which we are still trying to improve so it could match the imported ones," Donny said.\par \par \uc2 Fertilizer industries\par \par \uc2 PT Pupuk Indonesia\uc2  production director Bob Indiarto said the company was having trouble securing enough diammonium phosphate (DAP) and potassium chloride (KCI), which are necessary to produce subsidized nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilizer.\par \par \uc2 The company sources most of its DAP from Russia, whereas most of its KCI was sourced from China, which has placed export restrictions on the chemical.\par \par \uc2 Bob said the firm had been lobbying the Russian Embassy in Indonesia to address the DAP supply. In response to China's export ban, the company was trying to source KCI elsewhere, such as from Spain, with the help of Indonesian state-owned mining holding MIND ID.\par \par \uc2 "For now, we estimate the stock is safe until August, but we are thinking about beyond August," Bob said on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian government announced on April 5 that it would cut back on its subsidized fertilizer program to shield the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  from rising commodity prices.\par \par \uc2 Coordinating \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2  said the government would reduce the types of subsidized fertilizer available for producers. The government will only provide subsidized NPK and urea. It will no longer provide subsidized ZA, SP-36 and organic fertilizers.\par \par \uc2 Airlangga said the government needed to cut back the fertilizer program as urea prices were nearing $1,000 per ton and as supplies were disrupted because Indonesia imported several raw fertilizer ingredients from Ukraine. The government would prioritize distributing subsidized fertilizers to producers of priority commodities, including rice, corn, soy beans, shallots, chilies, cocoa and sugarcane smallholders.\par \par \uc2 "The President underlined the importance of getting fertilizer \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  delivered to targeted beneficiaries. [We hope] rising fertilizer prices will not lead to a shortage of fertilizers," he said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220413ei4d0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

Women play a very (extensive) role in creative work or (entrepreneurship)," Silalahi said.\par \par \uc2 Of all SMEs in Indonesia, 62 percent are owned by women at the micro scope.\par \par \uc2 This fact emphasizes that women as entrepreneurs need to be empowered. Thus, support for a very large percentage of women is necessary.\par \par \uc2 However, they are hindered by challenges such as lack of financial literacy, access to credit, and investment.\par \par \uc2 Women entrepreneurs also face issues related to \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  procurement, she said.\par \par \uc2 Silalahi then expressed her appreciation for the collaboration, which is geared toward creating more inclusive business practices.\par \par \uc2 It is expected that stakeholders will make a greater commitment to women entrepreneurs\u8217\'20\'19 empowerment.\par \par \uc2 She asked everyone to emphasize recovery for achieving gender equality and women\u8217\'20\'19s empowerment.\par \par \uc2 "Women and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are one of the four priority issues which we discuss at the G20," she informed.\par \par \uc2 Women at the center of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\par \par \uc2 W20 delegate from Italy, Annamaria Tartaglia, said that the COVID-19 pandemic has offered a great opportunity to put women at the center of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity.\par \par \uc2 The pandemic has worsened the challenges for women as well as accentuated gender inequality.\par \par \uc2 "But the pandemic has also provided a great opportunity to place women at the center of our \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and societal activities," Tartaglia said.\par \par \uc2 There are three things that need to be done to empower women, she added. The first is encouraging women to delve into the center of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activities, which will determine their future.\par \par \uc2 The second is the creation of an inclusive society and workplace culture, which can eliminate gender stereotypes.\par \par \uc2 The third is support for women in achieving leadership and business ownership, she said.\par \par \uc2 She recommended five policies for empowering women.\par \par \uc2 The first is putting gender equality at the heart of budgeting decisions by creating an inclusive and innovative \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  model that works for women and focuses on achieving \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  welfare, she said.\par \par \uc2 The second is ensuring equal representation of women at all levels of decision-making, whether in \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  or private, national or global, political or \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  bodies, by 2030, and implementing a multi-year plan to achieve this goal and monitoring progress annually.\par \par \uc2 The third is collecting, analyzing, and reporting all identified issues using gender-sensitive data.\par \par \uc2 The fourth is developing gender impact assessments, which do not leave anyone behind in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of all \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2 , political, strategic, and program initiatives, including post-pandemic reconstruction plans and climate change strategies.\par \par \uc2 The fifth is promoting education by investing in infrastructure to ensure women and girls have proper access to education from the pre-school to tertiary education levels.\par \par \uc2 Support also needs to be provided to women in technical and vocational training, digital skills, finance and entrepreneurship, and lifelong learning.\par \par \uc2 By continuing their education, women can get good job opportunities.\par \par \uc2 Improving women"s entrepreneurship ability is important and needs to be encouraged.\par \par \uc2 It is so that women can manage MSMEs, which are at the heart of national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  power and resilience can be built if women are economically empowered.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-MCA/A/R013/R013) 16-04-2022 20:12:53\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220416ei4g0015q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 The bearer of bad news\b0\par\par\uc2 595 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 No one in the government seems to want to be the bearer of bad news, not in the current political climate affected by the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and a general election just two years away.\par \par \uc2 Nobody is telling the people to prepare for what will hit them in the coming weeks or months even as we see prices of fuel and basic foodstuffs creeping up or already soaring. Instead, ministers are giving assurances that Indonesia has enough supplies of these commodities for the duration of Ramadan. But at what price is something they are deliberately neglecting to tell us.\par \par \uc2 These denials are giving false hopes to the nation, including academics. As part of the April 11 nationwide student protests, one of the demands was for the government to bring down food and fuel prices. Clearly, this is impossible to do given the soaring prices in world markets caused by global shortages because of the Ukrainian war.\par \par \uc2 Typically, since the pandemic-induced \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recession in 2020, the government's response has been to create more \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  schemes, either direct to consumers or indirect to producers, at each turn of events. We are seeing a plethora of new entitlements designed to cushion the poor, from cash transfers to pre-work \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the latest, a \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to buy cooking oil. With the government reluctant to increase the price of gasoline, the \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  bill is further stretching the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While there is a strong case to maintain \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  for the poorest of the poor, many of these schemes are so badly administered that much of the state money is going to the people who least deserve it.\par \par \uc2 How long can the government continue \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  its way out of the crisis? Keep this up, it will bankrupt the country. Indonesia could follow Sri Lanka in defaulting on its international debt. And that's when the real hardships will begin; something similar if not worse than the 1998 recession, which was so massive that it led to political turmoil and the downfall of the Soeharto regime.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  early this month openly criticized his Cabinet ministers for making statements that he said did not reflect the sense of crisis the nation is facing. Jokowi could have been more forceful with his close aides who have been completely out of sync, particularly those who had led a campaign to keep him in power beyond 2024 -- a clear violation of the Consitution.\par \par \uc2 The national debate on extending his presidential term unnecessarily consumed much of the nation's time and resources, including the massive student protests last week, which should have been expended on preparing the nation to face this imminent \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi should take a leaf from Soeharto's rule book on dealing with \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crises. Soeharto would "tighten the belt", introduce strict monetary and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies and then appeal to the nation to join the government in making sacrifices for the good of the country. This would be followed by the government and its top officials leading a frugal living with an austere \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This would not necessarily work 100 percent, but to be seen as leading by example is important to win \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  support. What is clear, Indonesia will not be able to survive the coming \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis without everyone making their share of sacrifices.\par \par \uc2 This is obviously not going to work if everyone in the government wants to be seen to be the one bringing glad tidings, and none to deliver the bad news.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220417ei4h00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Azis Kurmala\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia"s G20 Presidency is seeking to provide benefits to developed and developing countries in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 "This is where we actually see Indonesia"s role as very important. We want to make the Indonesian Presidency not only benefit the 20 largest economies, but also have an impact on other countries, especially developing countries," Director General of Information and \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Diplomacy (IDP) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Teuku Faizasyah said at the \u8216\'20\'18Social Activity of the G20 Presidency of Indonesia"s Energy Transition Priority Sector,\u8217\'20\'19 held online on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, Indonesia has become very active in inviting representatives of developing countries to participate in G20 discussions, he added.\par \par \uc2 "Of course, as the G20 Presidency, Indonesia has the flexibility to set big themes," Faizasyah remarked.\par \par \uc2 Specifically, themes that provide benefits not only to the global community, but are in the national interests of Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the Indonesian G20 Presidency has chosen \u8216\'20\'18Recover Together, Recover Stronger\u8217\'20\'19 as its theme.\par \par \uc2 The three main priorities of Indonesia"s G20 Presidency are global health architecture, digital-based \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  transformation, and energy transition. These priorities are being used to set a new discussion agenda (flagship agenda) in the Working Group (WG) and Engagement Group (EG) Sherpa Track.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf we go back to 1999, the G20 was established to respond to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis facing the world. The \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis occurred because of the global financial crisis at that time,\u8221\'20\'1D Faizasyah noted.\par \par \uc2 By building a spirit of cooperation and collective leadership, the G20 offered a solution to the financial crisis at the time.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThen, we followed this forum in 2008 and 2009 due to the continuation of the financial crisis, the status of G20 has been upgraded to a meeting at the level of heads of government/state," he pointed out.\par \par \uc2 This shows that the G20 is truly an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  forum for addressing various global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  challenges, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Especially at this time, after two years, we have felt a very heavy impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic," Faizasyah added.\par \par \uc2 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a slowdown in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth worldwide and created \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the momentum of the Indonesian Presidency provides a privilege.\par \par \uc2 "We understand that COVID-19 has caused a multidimensional crisis that started from a crisis in the health sector, then became an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis, and in the end became a prolonged social crisis," Faizasyah said.\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/R013/R013) 22-04-2022 18:59:09\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220422ei4m001bc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Acting regional heads: Small mandate, big responsibilities\b0\par\par\uc2 965 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Herman N. Suparman, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 The government will be appointing acting regional heads to replace the 271 governors, regents and mayors whose terms end this year and next. Challenges await these interim leaders, who will face a different structural landscape.\par \par \uc2 Besides \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  over when the COVID-19 pandemic will end, the paradigm shift in a number of national policies offers a new and demanding context for these acting leaders. Therefore, the selection of accountable officials and support for the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  governance design and central-regional institutional relations will be crucial.\par \par \uc2 During the pandemic, the government enforced two strategic policies: the Job Creation Law and the Central-Regional \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  Relations Law (HKPD).\par \par \uc2 The jobs law amended a number of provisions in more than 70 laws to clear barriers to investment and hence, job creation. One of the most striking changes the law brought was the paradigm shift of business licensing from a permit-based to a risk-based approach.\par \par \uc2 These changes didn't land smoothly. The national policies are not yet solid, egocentrism typifies ministries and agencies, and digital government services are as yet unintegrated under the Online Single Submission Risk-Based Approach (OSS RBA). In the regions, apart from capacity constraints, confusion over the content of the law has prevented local administrations from formulating good policies.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the HKPD Law seeks to increase regional administrations' \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  capacity and \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  quality. On the income side, besides simplifying local \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2  and levies, the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  has introduced an open scheme. On the \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2  side, the law has been deemed progressive for setting a 30 percent \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  cap on personnel expenditures and a 40 percent \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  floor on infrastructure. This provision is expected to address the classic problem of burdensome bureaucracy \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The 2021 Regional Autonomy Watch (KPPOD) review, however, shows that the changes made in the HKPD Law are not yet fundamental because they only simplify \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  rates. The central government does not yet dare transfer the authority to collect income \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  (PPh) and land and building ownership \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  (PBB) to regional administrations. In addition, as regards personnel and infrastructure \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the thresholds will work only if bureaucratic reform materializes.\par \par \uc2 Another strategic \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is the passage of the State Capital City (IKN) Law, which will impact regional governance, especially Jakarta. This issue is crucial, considering that a change of guard will occur in Jakarta as it transitions from a Special Capital Region to another designation that may have other special powers.\par \par \uc2 Controversy has marked the \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and enactment of the three laws. The dynamics indicate that the government and local administrations have hard work ahead in enforcing these policies.\par \par \uc2 The most crucial thing at this time is implementing the Job Creation Law, especially the OSS RBA, after the Constitutional Court declared the law conditionally unconstitutional in November last year and ordered its revision within two years.\par \par \uc2 The court's decision has prompted various interpretations among legal experts and practitioners, and among central and regional governments.\par \par \uc2 In this state of multiple interpretations, the central government has instructed regional administrations to continue to formulate related policies. But they have been reluctant to follow the order, first and foremost because drafting the implementing policies requires large funding. This attitude is understandable, especially because of the central government's \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  flip-flop.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the HKPD Law mandates changes to \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  governance at the subnational level.\par \par \uc2 First, regional administrations must revise their local regulations on \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2  and levies. The main challenge here is not actually revising their number, but striking a balance between \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2  and levies as instruments to collect revenue and to promote an inclusive \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Second, on the \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2  side, the most crucial challenge is that regional administrations must begin adjusting their personnel expenditures and infrastructure \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Although the law provides a five-year transition period, these adjustments are no easy matter, especially for regional administrations whose bureaucratic \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  exceeds a third, let alone half, of their budgets.\par \par \uc2 The problem is intertwined with the poor structure and culture of regional development governance. The structural problem is evident in the fact that many regions lack focus in development planning and their capacity to absorb the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 . When it comes to culture, the neutrality of the local bureaucracy is questionable: the civil service is prone to politicization, especially during the regional elections.\par \par \uc2 The tangle can actually be minimized if the central government provides optimal guidance and supervision. However, the central government is also trapped by the same structural-cultural problem: \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  overlap between ministries that work in silos. This acute problem will haunt the implementation of the crucial Job Creation Law and the HKPD Law for the next two years.\par \par \uc2 Acting regional heads will be thrust into meeting these challenges. One to two years is not a short term for an interim official, who normally serve no longer than six months. These regional captains, despite the question of the people's mandate, have to follow up on central policies and programs as well as direct all stakeholders, especially the civil service, to stay focused on regional development programs.\par \par \uc2 Selecting the right people to carry out this job will only be possible if the central government meets two conditions.\par \par \uc2 First, the selection process is accountable and transparent. The selected officials must truly be competent and experienced in governance (planning, budgeting, policies, institutions and \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  services).\par \par \uc2 Second, it must "help" ease the burden of the appointed officials by solving its own structural problems, such as overlapping and flip-flopping policies.\par \par \uc2 The clearer the rules of the game, the easier the acting regional heads can plan and execute their development programs. Once these two conditions are fulfilled, the acting leaders will be able to bring progress to their regions, instead of a mess.\par \par \uc2 _____________________\par \par \uc2 Executive director of Regional Autonomy Watch (KPPOD)\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220425ei4p0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Lead Co-Chair of T20 Indonesia Prof. \uc2 Bambang P. S. Brodjonegoro\uc2  stated that digital transformation becomes key to change the digital status quo or outdated technologies.\par \par \uc2 "Digital transformation becomes the key to change the digital status quo," the professor noted at the launch of Smarter World Innovation Challenge (SWIC) 2022 themed "Unleashing Global Urban and Rural Digitalization Potential" held by the Task Force 2 Think 20 Indonesia here on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Brodjonegoro remarked that despite the rapid spread and fast adoption of digital technologies, several problems arose among G20 countries based on demographics, industry, and socioeconomic status categories among citizens. This, he believes has raised concerns about the inclusiveness of digital transformation.\par \par \uc2 Apart from issues of inclusiveness, Brodjonegoro also drew attention to the issue of maintaining the status quo that is mainly due to the use of outdated technologies that may no longer be supported by their creators.\par \par \uc2 He said this issue could create a barrier when companies look to integrate all systems with new technology.\par \par \uc2 "This issue typically arises when the government maintains outdated procurement methods instead of actively seeking new technologies. The cybersecurity race increases as we keep using the legacy system or outdated technologies. Lack of updates pose challenges, as the system is prone to cyberattacks or wastefulness," he explained.\par \par \uc2 When people fail to keep up with digital information, Brodjonegoro believes it may drive away emerging talent in the digital labor market. Workplace culture tends to become stagnant, thereby creating a barrier to digital transformation, he pointed out.\par \par \uc2 Hence, he assessed that digital transformation is the key to change the digital status quo. He said it would be a major challenge to transform digital infrastructure. In addition, geographical and administrative barriers, regulatory \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , high capital \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and lack of basic infrastructure, such as internet and electricity, can be other barriers.\par \par \uc2 Hence, Brodjonegoro opined that digital transformation should be accompanied with guidelines and regulations, so that transformation can enhance security, improve efficiency, and address emerging social and organizational challenges.\par \par \uc2 He emphasized that further investment in digital infrastructure, especially high-speed broadband networks, are therefore essential to support an innovative and inclusive digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in G20 countries.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, he is upbeat that the SWIC 2022 event would increase \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  awareness on how digital technology could improve the innovation curve in solving G20 key priority areas as well as encouraging the youth to participate and be part of the largest G20 youth competition.\par \par \uc2 (T.K012/A/H-SHT/H-SHT) 26-04-2022 17:50:54\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220426ei4q0018h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

The problem is that the country depends on imports for almost 60 percent of its fuel, 100 percent of its wheat and 50 percent of soybeans.\par \par \uc2 Adjusting the domestic prices of fuel, electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and fertilizer to international price rises will trigger hyperinflation, erode the purchasing power of the people and increase poverty. But simply increasing \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  could cause the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  to explode to an unmanageable level\par \par \uc2 Preliminary official estimates show that energy \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  could rise to Rp 320 trillion (US$22.4 billion) from an earlier target of Rp 134 trillion if oil prices remain above $100 per barrel, not including the fertilizer \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which was earlier budgeted at Rp 25.3 trillion. If this huge additional \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is allowed, the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  could exceed the 4.85 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) target this year, whereas the government is required by law to keep the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  below 3 percent of GDP in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Apparently concerned about the risks of hyperinflation and social instability, the government seems tempted to simply use the windfall revenues from the commodity boom to cover the bulk of the huge additional \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The government also seems to have been fully aware of the disadvantages of commodity-based (blanket) \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  schemes, which are vulnerable to abuse and corruption. The biggest challenge now is how the government can improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the data on the target beneficiaries for its social-safety net programs.\par \par \uc2 But the government also should realize that the commodity boom will not last forever. We have been familiar with such bouts of boom and bust. The government should not be lulled by the windfalls into complacency, and forget its reform agenda.\par \par \uc2 There are still many downside risks to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . External factors are mostly unfavorable. The \uc2 World Bank\uc2  last week reduced its global growth forecast for 2022 by nearly a full percentage point to 3.2 percent and the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  to 3.6 percent from its January forecast of 4.4 percent. The main reason is the Ukraine crisis with its many repercussions, notably on fuel and food prices.\par \par \uc2 True, our situation now is much better. \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 booked a $3.3 billion current account surplus for the whole of 2021. Indonesia's international trade continued to boom in March with another surplus of $4.5 billion. Foreign ownership of government bonds has declined from 40 percent in 2013 to about 19 percent now and our international \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  totaled $141.5 billion as of February, equivalent to 7.3 months of imports and government foreign debt servicing.\par \par \uc2 But faster-than-expected monetary tightening in the United States and the geopolitical \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  could still set off massive capital inflows from Indonesia, thereby forcing \uc2 BI\uc2  to tighten its money \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  earlier than planned.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220426ei4q00009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Businesses, trade unions call for expansion of wage  \highlight22\uc2 subsidy \highlight\uc2  scheme\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 824 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Businesses and trade unions have backed the Indonesian Ombudsman's call for the government to expand its wage \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  program (BSU) by including informal workers, to better shield the workforce from high inflation.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) and the Indonesian Workers Union Association (Aspek) said on Monday they supported the Ombudsman's proposal that the government included specific categories of informal workers such as online motorcycle taxi drivers (ojol), automotive repair workers and small-shops owners.\par \par \uc2 Manpower Ministerial \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  (Permenaker) No. 21/2021, the law that regulates the BSU, dictates that recipients should be registered with the Workers Social Security Agency (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) and have a maximum monthly wage of Rp 3.5 million (US$241).\par \par \uc2 Indonesian Ombudsman member Robert Na Endi Jaweng said that many informal workers were not BPJS Ketenagakerjaan members, despite being in the same \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  class as their formal counterparts.\par \par \uc2 "There is a real inequality here between those included in BPJS Ketenagakerjaan and those who are not, when in fact they are actually suffering the same due to poor \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions," Robert said during a press briefing on Friday.\par \par \uc2 The wage \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  aims to provide a buttress for workers in staving off the imminent threat of inflation, as the war between Russia and Ukraine has led to a drastic spike in global commodity prices. Inflation rose to a nearly two-year high of 2.64 percent in March due to the spike.\par \par \uc2 Economists have said that Indonesian inflation would accelerate in the coming months in response to the removal of more price controls, higher domestic demand amid easing COVID-19 curbs and the Ramadan and Idul Fitri holidays, a hike in value-added \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2  (VAT) and more \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war.\par \par \uc2 For 2022, Indonesia prepared Rp 8.8 trillion for a potential 8.8 million BSU recipients, where each would receive Rp 1 million. This year's \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  allocation is the same as the one implemented in the previous year.\par \par \uc2 Robert reiterated that, despite government concerns on data validation, including informal workers within the BSU was a matter of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  justice.\par \par \uc2 "One way or another, these workers should have the right to receive the BSU, as it will create a more inclusive environment," he added.\par \par \uc2 Aspek president Mirah Sumirat said the union supported the Ombudsman's recommendation regarding the BSU and stressed the need to pressure the government to implement it.\par \par \uc2 "The government should ask assistance from all parts of society to help them collect data. They need to open themselves to external help," said Mirah in a phone call on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Mirah called for the government to expand the BSU to cover all types of workers, something that Kadin also agrees with.\par \par \uc2 "We support the recommendation. More than that, we believe every worker that receives wages should receive the BSU," said Kadin deputy chairperson for manpower Adi Mahfudz in a written message to The Jakarta Post.\par \par \uc2 The mounting calls to expand the wage \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  program comes as the government plans to reduce its \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  deficits and debt accumulation, otherwise known as \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation. Indonesia plans to reinstate a \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  cap of 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2023.\par \par \uc2 The manpower minister's special staff Dita Indah Kurniasari said that BPJS Ketenagakerjaan already provided a scheme to support informal workers through the non-wage recipient (BPU) scheme.\par \par \uc2 The BPU scheme provides accident insurance, life insurance and old-age benefits for members, whose premiums are adjusted to their wages. Members also include freelancers, part-time workers and entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 "This is an old program but still has low membership compared with [the program for] formal workers. Thus, we shall focus our efforts on raising awareness about this program," said Dita.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, she stated that facilitating training would be the primary approach for the government to help small and micro-enterprises develop.\par \par \uc2 Center of \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Law Studies (CELIOS) director Bhima Yudhistira said informal workers urgently needed the BSU, as they formed around 40 percent of workers with the lowest domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , where a slight price increase in basic needs would drag them below the poverty line.\par \par \uc2 "There are around 70 million informal workers in Indonesia who have not yet received social security coverage from the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery (PEN) \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he added.\par \par \uc2 Commenting on budgetary concerns, Bhima said the government could reallocate windfall gains from high commodity prices and from National Strategic Projects (PSNs) to fund the expanded wage \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Ombudsman's Robert, also on Friday, reported that 9 percent of last year's 8.2 million BSU applicants failed to receive the funds due to data errors and thus, recommended the government, BPJS Ketenagakerjaan and banks, as fund distributors, enhance their data management system.\par \par \uc2 "Data management reforms should be expedited to increase the worker's welfare, reduce inequality, and spur \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth," Robert said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220426ei4q0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 The Cry of Refugees\b0\par\par\uc2 1,485 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 TAHIR Asad\u8217\'20\'19s tears flowed down after he finished his phone conversation. Asad, 36, is a refugee from Afghanistan, and had just finished talking to his mother back home. He could not control his overwhelming emotions that have been tormenting him for the past decade.\par \par \uc2 Until now, his wish to reside in Australia has not come to fruition. \u8220\'20\'1CMother just called from Afghanistan to ask how things are. She warned me not to be reckless in continuing my journey unless it gets support from the \uc2 UNHCR\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D he said in Indonesian on Thursday, April 21.\par \par \uc2 Asad is one of the refugees who fled his country due to the ongoing civil war in his motherland. He set foot in Indonesia in October 2012, together with dozens of others with the same fate. Initially, they did not know one another.\par \par \uc2 A travel agent offered a US$10,500 ticket to Australia on a fast ship using alternate routes. However, Australia has yet to open its doors. They were only meant to be on transit in Indonesia. \u8220\'20\'1CWe also don\u8217\'20\'19t want to be here. Our destination is Australia,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Asad currently lives with thousands of other refugees in the Puncak area in Cisarua, Bogor, West Java. Their presence was mentioned by Bogor Mayor Ade Yasin in March.\par \par \uc2 Ade asked the government and international agencies such as the \uc2 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\uc2  (UNCHR) to find a replacement solution for the refugees and asylum seekers. Their presence is seen as sparking social problems and tarnishing Puncak\u8217\'20\'19s image as a tourist destination.\par \par \uc2 There are 2,309 refugees and asylum seekers from Middle Eastern countries in Bogor. Some 1,690 have been residing in the Puncak area in the past decade. Some live side by side with local residents, while others stay at shelters.\par \par \uc2 The refugees are spread around almost in all villages in the Cisarua subdistrict, such Leuwimalang, Jogjogan, Kopo, Citeko, Cibereum, Batulayang, Tugu Utara, and Tugu Selatan. Others choose to live around the regency of Cianjur, Sukabumi, and the city of Bogor.\par \par \uc2 Ade said that the presence of the refugees could easily spark social conflicts with local residents, and lead up to criminal incidents. Because of their high numbers, the area is now known as \u8216\'20\'18Kampung Arab\u8217\'20\'19 or Arabic Village.\par \par \uc2 The area has suffered from a negative image, as it is seen as a prostitution site under the guise of contract marriages. \u8220\'20\'1CAs the shelters are concentrated in one area, it is prone to incite conflicts and law violations,\u8221\'20\'1D Ade said.\par \par \uc2 Being a refugee is no walk in the park. Many of them suffer from depressions. \u8220\'20\'1CMany of us have died from diseases, and some have committed suicide due to stress,\u8221\'20\'1D said Tahir Asad.\par \par \uc2 Assistance provided by donor institutions has also been limited. It is only enough for rent and a little bit of food. Some refugees are lucky that they still have family in their native land.\par \par \uc2 Asad admitted that he still gets money wired every month. \u8220\'20\'1CSometimes I get between Rp2-3 million. And even that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t cover things.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He says that he is ashamed if he has to ask for his monthly money earlier. So, he would just go hungry, or ask for food from fellow refugees. Asad, who now works as a teacher at the Peace Education Shelter, said he uses the shelter as his home.\par \par \uc2 Asad and other refugees must pay between Rp500,000 and Rp1 million every month if they want to rent a home. This, he said, is too expensive for them.\par \par \uc2 The shelter is located in the Batulayang village, Cisarua, and has been Asad\u8217\'20\'19s home, at no cost, for the past four years. The shelter, facilitated by the \uc2 UNHCR\uc2 , is also an informal school for refugee children.\par \par \uc2 At the shelter, Asad teaches English, Indonesian, and the local Afghan language. \uc2 UNHCR\uc2  data notes that around 1,000 children go to school at a number of shelters.\par \par \uc2 Tempo requested an interview with the \uc2 UNHCR\uc2 . However, until Monday, April 25, the request letter has been left unanswered.\par \par \uc2 An Indonesian representative of the UNCHR, who declined to be named, admitted that financial support available for the refugees and asylum seekers are limited. From some 13,000 people throughout Indonesia, only around 1,000 receive facilities, the representative said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe focus on those who are vulnerable, such as children with no family,\u8221\'20\'1D the person said.\par \par \uc2 The non-profit \uc2 International Organization for Migration\uc2  (\uc2 IOM\uc2 ) had given considerable support for the refugees, funding some 5,000 of them. However, it was stopped in 2018.\par \par \uc2 When asked for confirmation, IOM National Project Officer Eny Rofiatul Ngazizah said she could not give further explanation. \u8220\'20\'1CMaybe our Chief of Mission could give comments on Thursday or Friday,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 UNHCR\uc2  source said that the handling of refugees and immigrants in Indonesia receives no priority. Refugees and asylum seekers in countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, reaching in the millions, are also forced to figure out their own funding.\par \par \uc2 Tahir Asad, at the Peace Education Shelter learning center, where informal education is given specifically for children of Middle Eastern immigrants, at the Batulayang village, Puncak, West Java. TEMPO/M. Sidik Permana\par \par \uc2 Presidential Decree No. 125/2016, regarding the handling of overseas refugees actually allows funding being taken from the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Authority for this is in the hands of local administrations. \u8220\'20\'1CAlas, not many have taken notice,\u8221\'20\'1D the source said.\par \par \uc2 Until August 2021, the \uc2 UNHCR\uc2  has already given some US$17.5 million, or Rp251 billion, in support to Indonesia. The limited funds has forced them to seek donations from various sources.\par \par \uc2 In addition to donations sites on social media, they also design philanthropic movements by opening outlets at busy locations, such as the Cibinong City Mall in Bogor, as seen on Wednesday, April 20. Some youngsters with blue shirts on the ground floor invite visitors to give donations.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 UNHCR\uc2  source said the Puncak area has remained a preferred destination for the refugees and asylum seekers as it already has the social structure of a Middle Eastern community that has been built up for a long time. The local residents are also considered friendly.\par \par \uc2 The sprawling tea plantations\u8212\'20\'14heritage from the colonial times\u8212\'20\'14are pleasing to the eyes. At a height of between 800 meters and 1,200 meters above sea level, the area has temperatures of between 12 and 22 degrees Celsius. \u8220\'20\'1CSometimes it is difficult to differentiate between refugees and tourists from the Middle East,\u8221\'20\'1D the source said.\par \par \uc2 The government and \uc2 UNHCR\uc2  are unable to force the refugees to go back to their home country as the United Nations convention does not allow this. Basically, the source continued, the migrants are free to move around as they please.\par \par \uc2 They have asked for residency in a number of countries such as Canada, the United States, and Australia. \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, very few have been successful. This is why many have been forced to stay at transit areas such as Indonesia,\u8221\'20\'1D the source said.\par \par \uc2 Unlike those countries, the source noted, Indonesia does not yet have policies to smooth out the process of refugee integration. As a result, the refugees only get limited support for basic needs.\par \par \uc2 The UNCHR claims that it is not against plans of the Bogor Regency to relocate the Middle Eastern refugees and asylum seekers to other places. \u8220\'20\'1CIf there are options to do farming in other locations, where is the land for that? Would that not create new conflicts? This is also a problem,\u8221\'20\'1D the source said.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Ade Yasin said he is ready to provide land, although there is no certainty yet regarding the location. He is considering several locations, such as the Mount Sindur area.\par \par \uc2 Local administration\u8217\'20\'19s authority to decide on shelters is regulated in the Presidential Decree No. 125/2016, article 26, paragraph 1. As long as those policies are not set, Ade said, the Bogor Regency would continue to follow the movements of the refugees.\par \par \uc2 The Bogor Regency has responded to the matter of immigrants and refugees by issuing a Mayoral \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 83/2018, regarding the supervision of refugees amidst residents in the Bogor Regency. The supervision is supported by a Foreign Refugee Handling Task Force through a Mayoral Decree No. 472/314Kpts/Per-UU/2021. \u8220\'20\'1CWe continue to coordinate with the police, district military, and international organizations such as the \uc2 UNHCR\uc2  and \uc2 IOM\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D Ade said.\par \par \uc2 Khaidir Rusli, activist of Puncak\u8217\'20\'19s customary community, has asked the government to bridge the refugees\u8217\'20\'19 wishes to access their destination countries such as Canada and Australia. \u8220\'20\'1CThey actually also don\u8217\'20\'19t feel at home in Puncak,\u8221\'20\'1D said Kang Iding, as Khaidir is often called.\par \par \uc2 Living dozens of years in \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  not only has social and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  impacts on immigrants. \u8220\'20\'1CTheir children also don\u8217\'20\'19t get proper education,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 RIKY FERDIANTO, M.

\par\par \b \uc2 Defense procurement deals pave way for strategic autonomy\b0\par\par\uc2 1,006 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Anastasia Febiola S. , Jakarta\par \par \uc2 The Russian invasion of Ukraine has revived debate in many countries on strategic autonomy and their reliance on partners and allies.\par \par \uc2 While Kyiv has received support from its partner nations through the steady delivery of military equipment and weaponry, such as anti-tank weapons, man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and support equipment, Ukraine has also seen several countries turning to focus on their immediate interests, which are not compatible with alienating Russia.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Tel Aviv is banning other countries from sending Israeli-made weapon systems to Ukraine in order to maintain good ties with Moscow.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, it took Germany weeks to start delivering weapons to Ukraine as it weighed the pros and the cons of the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  amid its dependence on Russia's energy supply.\par \par \uc2 Such cases show that military aid and the arms trade cannot be separated from a country's foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and national interests, and that countries should anticipate such risks.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, despite the steady delivery of military equipment to Ukraine, the high intensity of the conflict has shown that states should also anticipate such kinds of crises. It has also led several nations to rethink their ideas on strategic autonomy, a concept that originally focused on the defense industry.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\uc2  defines strategic autonomy as a way to "chart its own course in line with its interests and values" in order to "manage interdependence in the best possible way". The concept was mainly developed by France in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 In other words, strategic autonomy grants a country the ability to face and handle major geopolitical disturbances and should be understood to be not limited to the defense and security sectors.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia has faced difficulties in the past that have hampered its autonomy and led the government to diversify its supply sources in terms of procuring military equipment. Jakarta adopted the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 1990s, when it was embargoed by the United States and its allies over human rights violations in East Timor.\par \par \uc2 As a result, Indonesia struggled with acquiring spare aircraft parts and challenges in its Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations, and this reportedly reduced the Indonesian Military's (TNI) operational readiness by 50 percent.\par \par \uc2 Besides the US, the United Kingdom also prohibited Indonesia from using its Scorpion tanks for Jakarta's military operations in Aceh. Since then, Indonesia has been purchasing its weapons from various countries, including Russia.\par \par \uc2 In recent times, the foreign policies of other countries' remain a looming threat to Indonesia's military modernization strategy. Jakarta's plan to procure Sukhoi-35 combat aircraft from Russia has been deferred over the risk of being sanctioned under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).\par \par \uc2 Keeping in mind that while political sanctions such as CAATSA are enforced to deter and prevent a country's adversaries from obtaining key weapons systems and technology, controlling arms exports can also be seen as a way to not only maximize export opportunities, but also "control" its allies and provide room for political maneuvering in certain times.\par \par \uc2 In other words, restricting the trade in weapons can be perceived as a strategy to minimize the risk of partner countries from supporting adversaries in times of crisis.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Indonesia has been focusing for years on developing its strategic autonomy and the benefits it could gain through it. Actually, Indonesia can rely on Law No. 16/2012 on the defense industry to strengthen its strategic autonomy. The law obliges suppliers to provide offset or transfer of technology (ToT) programs as part of defense procurement deals.\par \par \uc2 The recent acquisition of Rafale combat aircraft and the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the procurement and domestic development of Scorpene-class submarines have opened a path for Indonesia to strengthen its strategic autonomy through key French defense technologies.\par \par \uc2 In fact, Jakarta could opt for the most beneficial offset programs that will not only benefit the TNI and the national defense industry, but also the civilian sector through dual-use technologies. ead of Strategy of the \uc2 French Ministry of Armed Forces\uc2 , Alice Guitton.\par \par \uc2 One of the ToT programs that Indonesia could get from the submarine deal is lithium battery technology that could also be developed and used for commercial purposes to eventually develop the country's battery industry. It is important to note that Indonesia is the world's main producer of nickel, a key material in producing lithium batteries.\par \par \uc2 As the government of President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  aspires to turn the country into the global hub of the battery industry, such key technologies acquired from defense procurement deals further emphasize that batteries could become a "strategic product" for the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and trade. By doing so, Indonesia will be able to produce lithium batteries for the domestic automotive industry and eventually expand export capacity.\par \par \uc2 Second, by obtaining relevant ToT programs and the ability to produce modern and high-tech defense equipment, Indonesia will be able to reinforce its strategic autonomy through the defense modernization program.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the ongoing partnership with France makes sense. Since early 2022, France's top defense officials have visited Jakarta, the latest being its head of strategy at the Armed Forces Ministry, Alice Guitton.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Defense Minister \uc2 Prabowo Subianto\uc2  met with French President \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2  in Paris in March and held talks with Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly during her Jakarta visit earlier this month to advance strategic bilateral cooperation.\par \par \uc2 In this perspective, defense procurement deals that are in line with the Defense Ministry's long-term modernization program could certainly be a way to strengthen the country's strategic autonomy. Amid the current geopolitical \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , strategic autonomy matters in Indonesia's quest for recognition in international politics.\par \par \uc2 To a greater extent, strategic autonomy could help the country protect its national interests and sovereignty, as well as boost its self-dependence, especially in times of crisis.\par \par \uc2 ___________________\par \par \uc2 Research analyst on defense affairs at Semar Sentinel PTE Ltd.

The government banned the export of all crude palm oil (CPO) products, Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Oil (RBD Palm Oil), Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Olein (RBD Palm Olein), and Used Cooking Oil (UCO).\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  takes effect from Thursday, April 28. CPO products will be optimized for domestic needs and the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  will remain in place until the price of bulk cooking oil returns to its highest retail price of Rp14,000 per liter.\par \par \uc2 Prior to the announcement of the export ban, Bhima informed, the CPO reference price at the global level had experienced turmoil. He cited an example that on the Malaysian stock exchange, the reference price penetrated 6,980 ringgit per tonne, up 9.06 percent as of Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 Other than international lawsuits, the economist argued that the export ban would have the opportunity to suppress the rupiah exchange rate to Rp15,000 per US dollar. Indonesia might also lose its palm oil trading partners as export destination countries look for other trading partners.\par \par \uc2 Bhima also said that the government's inconsistency in making the rules on CPO would also cause the policies to be taken prematurely and have damaging effects on all elements. \u8220\'20\'1CThis \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  will surely erode the dignity of the government as a strategic policymaker in the eyes of palm oil and plantation business actors,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Read: Trade Minister Issues \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  on Export Ban on CPO, UCO, RBD Effective Today\par \par \uc2 FRANCISCA CHRISTY ROSANA\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/04/28/id_1106417/1106417_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020220428ei4s0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) called to increase food and energy productivity since both sectors were critical for the future.\par \par \uc2 "I urge related stakeholders to increase productivity and independence in the food and energy sectors. In future, the world will face two problems in the areas of food and energy. These are very critical," Jokowi noted at the State Palace, Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi made the statement at the opening of the 2022 National Development Planning Conference also attended by Coordinating Minister for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Affairs \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2 , Minister of National Development Planning/Head of the Development Planning Agency (\uc2 Bappenas\uc2 ) Suharso Manoarfa, Minister of Home Affairs Tito Karnavian, Minister of State Secretary Pratikno, and related officials.\par \par \uc2 "Fortunately, we have the power here in Indonesia. Hence, to increase productivity and independence in the food and energy sector, we must focus on working together and monitoring it very well," Jokowi affirmed.\par \par \uc2 The head of state also pressed for working towards increasing investment that would create more job opportunities.\par \par \uc2 "This will become a contest between countries. If our licensing service is not fast, both at the center and in the regions, please immediately simplify and accelerate to serve everything related to investment," he emphasized.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi also noted that ministries, institutions, and local governments must look for alternative sources of financing.\par \par \uc2 "We can no longer depend on the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  and regional \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Hence, we must be creative in finding new innovative funding sources by continuously increasing investment," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi acknowledged that in 2022 and 2023, Indonesia will face a difficult situation as well as a volatile and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and political situation.\par \par \uc2 "The pandemic is not completely over. Several countries are still struggling to suppress the spread of COVID-19 with lockdown. Then, there is a supply chain disruption that has an impact everywhere," he noted.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the president pointed out that the world was hit by a conflict between Russia and Ukraine that caused an energy and food crisis.\par \par \uc2 "Those would cause global inflation and a decline in \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RST/A/S022/S022) 28-04-2022 13:41:51\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220428ei4s0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesian Deputy Minister of FinanceSuahasil Nazarahas said that \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  is expected to remain high in 2023 because of escalating global risks, such as geopolitical and inflationary pressures and monetary tightening.\par \par \uc2 Despite projections of the COVID-19 pandemic being brought under control, the risks will still linger, especially regarding state revenues, he explained at the 2022 National Development Planning Conference here on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "All these global risks will have an impact on state revenues but, at the same time, the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  will continue to protect the community and be transferred to the regions," Nazara said.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023 will still be directed at consolidation toward realizing a \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of below three percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), he added.\par \par \uc2 However, \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  by ministries/institutions should encourage \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, he stressed.\par \par \uc2 Thus, government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  must be "sharpened" to make it flexible, productive, effective, and anticipatory in response to \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  dynamics, the deputy minister said. "The state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  serves as a shock absorber," he noted.\par \par \uc2 Further, the government is aiming to streamline \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023, in line with the phasing out of COVID-19 handling and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery efforts.\par \par \uc2 Government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  next year will also focus on flexibility in anticipating \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and improving services.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the 2023 state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  will prioritize increasing \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  productivity through improving the quality of human resources, completing infrastructure development, and bureaucratic reform, Nazara informed.\par \par \uc2 "We design the government"s work plan; this is the direction of \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions and \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  going forward," he said.\par \par \uc2 He further said he is optimistic that the entire work plan will be realized to encourage \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery and protect the Indonesian people.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, Nazara had said there is a possibility that Indonesia"s inflation rate will rise to four percent in 2023.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-KZU/A/R013/R013) 28-04-2022 17:47:01\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220428ei4s000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 RI ranks third in ASEAN on manufacturing PMI\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 757 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The mood of the local manufacturing industry has improved slightly over the past month to rise above most other ASEAN countries, a report released on Thursday shows.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) booked a monthly increase of 0.6 to 51.9 in April, while Thailand's rose 0.1 to the same level, according to a report published by HIS Markit, a subsidiary of financial information firm S&P Global.\par \par \uc2 The two countries rank third among ASEAN states according to the latest manufacturing PMI.\par \par \uc2 The report also shows that Indonesia's rate of improvement was the fastest since January, which it attributes to increased \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activities as a result of relaxed COVID-19 restrictions.\par \par \uc2 The report is based on a survey of manufacturing purchasing managers who were asked whether business conditions had improved or worsened over the past month in a number of indicators, including customer orders, supply deliveries and employment levels.\par \par \uc2 Singapore and the Philippines top the list, with the former booking an astounding 3.1-point month-to-month (mtm) increase in its manufacturing PMI to 58.1, while the latter increased 1.1 points to 54.1.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Vietnam's manufacturing PMI remained unchanged at 51.7 while Malaysia saw a 2- point mtm increase to 51.6.\par \par \uc2 The overall manufacturing PMI for ASEAN grew 1.1 points to 52.8 in the seventh consecutive month of improving figures.\par \par \uc2 "The growth momentum picked up across the ASEAN manufacturing sector in April as the headline PMI rose to the second highest on record. Stronger client demand supported increases in new orders and output. In turn, employment rose at near-record rates after contracting in the previous two survey periods," S&P Global economist Maryam Baluch is quoted as saying in the report.\par \par \uc2 S&P Global also noted that demand had begun to see a significant increase as pandemic restrictions were gradually lifted in ASEAN states, spurring new orders and increasing factory output.\par \par \uc2 As a result, manufacturing sector employment in the region increased for only the second time in the last 35 months, with job creation the second fastest ever recorded by the firm. Only Malaysia saw a decline in manufacturing employment in April.\par \par \uc2 "Whilst the region's manufacturing sector continues to recover from the recent waves of COVID-19 infections, persistent supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures are expected to remain headwinds to expansion," Baluch said in the report.\par \par \uc2 She added that rising global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  might exacerbate current obstacles to growth, singling out China's COVID-19 situation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine as risk factors.\par \par \uc2 While Indonesian purchasing managers remain generally optimistic about the business outlook for the next 12 months, business confidence has dropped from the previous month.\par \par \uc2 Several issues still plague the local manufacturing sector, such as supply constraints and price pressures due to global inflation.\par \par \uc2 "[Business] confidence fell sharply over April, and it will be worth monitoring the impact of higher inflationary pressures. With that said, the increase in purchasing activity and importantly, the solid expansion of workforce numbers, continued to reflect some confidence from firms for the near term," S&P Global economics associate director Jingyi Pan said in a separate report released on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 In response to the S&P Global reports, the Finance Ministry applauded the government's successful pandemic handling and expressed hope that manufacturers' inventory purchasing spree would generate a multiplier effect toward domestic recovery.\par \par \uc2 "To sustain strengthening consumption and production amid price pressures, the government is active in both price and non-price interventions through social protection for the poor and vulnerable, as well as through strong coordination between institutions to maintain balance between supply and demand," the ministry's \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency (BKF) head, Febrio Kacaribu, said in a press release on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Bhima Yudhistira, director of think tank Center of Economics and Law Studies (CELIOS), warned that input production costs could increase as a result of inflationary factors, meaning that an increase in sales would be less beneficial due to reduced profit margins.\par \par \uc2 He also told The Jakarta Post that he believed not all consumers could handle the burden of inflation-induced price increases from manufacturers. People living on lower or middle incomes would prefer affordable alternatives.\par \par \uc2 "The real challenge in the manufacturing sector will come after Idul Fitri," he said, as the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2 's rate hike would "affect the cost of funds, the cost of capital for businesses to expand".\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220506ei5600008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

He also reminded his staff to be mindful of the current global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil as the war in Ukraine is yet to show signs of ending and is rather showing signs of protracting.\par \par \uc2 Global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  has become increasingly \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  as a result of the war, and also due to United States\u8217\'20\'19 more aggressive monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in reducing inflation, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This will cause a recession in many countries. Therefore, macroeconomic management must really be followed in detail,\u8221\'20\'1D he explained, \u8220\'20\'1CAnd in terms of micromanagement, all state ministries tied to these issues must take notice of these issues on food and energy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Read: Researcher Highlights Need to Diversify National Food System\par \par \uc2 ANTARA\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2020/07/09/id_951507/951507_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020220510ei5a00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Inflationary pressures\b0\par\par\uc2 547 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's consumer price index surged 3.5 percent year-on-year (yoy) in April, the highest since 2018, due to the combination of stronger demand in the post-pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery and hikes in the administered prices of food and energy. Several analysts estimated that skyrocketing cooking oil prices contributed significantly to the monthly food inflation.\par \par \uc2 Stronger inflationary pressures are also expected if the government goes ahead with its plan to raise the administered prices of Pertalite gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas and electricity for middle-income consumers.\par \par \uc2 The immediate question then, is will \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 raise this month its benchmark interest rate which has been maintained at 3.5 percent since February 2021? The consensus among most analysts is that the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  would most likely wait until the second semester before raising its \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  rate. This is because core inflation in April was only 2.6 percent, meaning that the headline inflation was generated mostly by the rises in administered prices (supply side) of food and energy.\par \par \uc2 It is worthy of remembering though that Indonesia depends on imports for 60 percent of its fuel needs, 100 percent of wheat consumption and 60 percent of its soybeans and milk supply. It is therefore most important that the government resolves once and for all the cooking oil price mystery as the country is the world's largest producer of palm oil, the source of almost 95 percent of the nation's edible oil. If inflation spirals out of control, the growth of private consumption would weaken and unfortunately, inflation hits the fixed low-income group hardest.\par \par \uc2 In view of the lower \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth on a quarterly basis in the first quarter, \uc2 BI\uc2  would most likely focus more on sustaining the recovery rather than on the surging inflation. That does not, however, mean that the government should simply sit back and relax, as \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  caused by the Ukraine crisis will continue to disrupt food and energy supplies.\par \par \uc2 True, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.01 percent yoy in the first quarter, but it fell 0.96 percent on a quarterly basis despite the persistent boom in prices of Indonesian major commodities such as coal and palm oil.\par \par \uc2 But the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will continue to face headwinds, notably unfavorable external factors such as the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  about the Ukraine crisis which has been causing disruption in the global supply chains of various commodities, notably food and energy. The energy and food crisis will certainly feed into our inflationary pressures.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2  last week lifted its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to a range of 0.75 to 1 percent, its biggest increase in 22 years. The aggressive move, though it has been expected for many months, could induce capital outflows from Indonesia, especially if inflation is unusually high. This in turn would adversely affect the rupiah exchange rate, making imports much costlier with massive repercussions for \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  stability.\par \par \uc2 Another challenge is the urgent need for \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation to return the legal ceiling \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  to below 3 percent in 2023 from an estimated 4.58 percent of GDP this year at a time when food and energy \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  would likely increase significantly due to international price hikes.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020220511ei5b00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 BUSSINESS\par \b \uc2 KSP ATTRIBUTES INCREASED  \highlight22\uc2 PUBLIC \highlight\uc2  CONSUMPTION TO GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS\b0\par\par\uc2 593 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 May 2022\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The government"s efforts increased household consumption that also boosted strong \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in the first quarter of 2022 to 5.01 percent annually (year on year/yoy), Presidential Staff Office"s (KSP"s) Main Expert Staff, Edy Priyono, stated.\par \par \uc2 However, on the other hand, there was an increase in the prices of basic commodities that was influenced by global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Priyono noted on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "Despite the increase in prices of basic necessities, from the demand side, household consumption actually grew, which was 4.34 percent year on year, or higher than the growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was 3.55 percent (yoy)," he affirmed.\par \par \uc2 Priyono"s statement was related to the issue of the prices of basic necessities in the domestic market, which according to the Political Indicator Survey on May 15, had lowered the level of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  satisfaction with the performance of the government of President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  and Vice President \uc2 Ma"ruf Amin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Priyono claimed that the strong growth in household consumption was supported by the government"s policies to ease the people"s mobility in line with the control in the pandemic and the acceleration of COVID-19 vaccination.\par \par \uc2 "It is also due to the acceleration of distribution of social aid to strengthen the people"s purchasing power," he stated.\par \par \uc2 However, strengthening household consumption could also contribute to rising inflation. In April 2022, inflation was recorded at 0.95 percent on a monthly basis (month to month) or 3.47 percent on an annual basis (year to year).\par \par \uc2 "The high inflation also coincides with the Ramadan 2022 period, which cyclically increases demand," Priyono explained.\par \par \uc2 The KSP remains optimistic that the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in future will remain strong along with the government"s commitment to expediting COVID-19 vaccination, expanding the opening of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sectors, and providing various stimuli in the form of social assistance to the community.\par \par \uc2 Regarding the increase in the prices of basic commodities, Priyono said it cannot be separated from the global situation, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the normalization of policies in developed countries, and changes in weather conditions.\par \par \uc2 On account of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the prices of various commodities in the global market, including of food and energy, had increased, which eventually triggered price hikes in several countries.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf this condition continues, it could lead to an increase in inflation, a decrease in the people"s purchasing power and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, as well as exert \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  pressure, considering that the State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  is mostly used to provide social support for the community, especially the poor," Priyono stated.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the monetary policies of developed countries have put pressure on financial markets. This could result in fluctuations in the rupiah exchange rate as well as the potential for higher \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the financial market.\par \par \uc2 He ensured that the government would continue to optimize the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  to provide social assistance to reduce the impact of global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  on society, especially the poor.\par \par \uc2 The Political Indicators survey institute on May 15 released a survey which stated that \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  satisfaction with the performance of President Widodo - Vice President Amin decreased by six percent to 58.1 percent. The decline occurred one month after the last survey which stated that \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  satisfaction was recorded at 64.1 percent. The drastic decrease was attributed to the increase in the price of basic commodities.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RST/A/S022/S022) 17-05-2022 13:31:22\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020220517ei5h0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b  \highlight22\uc2 Public \highlight\uc2  Satisfaction Towards Jokowi Dwindles; Presidential Staff Office Explains\b0\par\par\uc2 315 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 May 2022\par \uc2 Tempo.co\par \uc2 TEMPOE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - A representative for the Presidential Staff Office (KSP) on Tuesday explained that the declining \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  satisfaction towards President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s performance by 6 percent was caused by the rising prices of staple goods. This refers to the survey conducted by pollster Indikator Politik Indonesia on May 15.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe rising prices of staple goods are closely tied to the global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , such as the Covid-19, the Russian-Ukraine conflict, and a number of policies issued by developed countries, and the weather,\u8221\'20\'1D said KSP expert staff Edy Priyono in a statement on Tuesday, May 17.\par \par \uc2 Edy defended that global conflicts affect the prices of commodities and do not only affect Indonesia but also the global market. "If this condition continues, it could lead to an increase in inflation, a decrease in people's purchasing power and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, and provide \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  pressure," said Eddy.\par \par \uc2 He claimed that the government is currently trying to control the price increase. One of them, according to him, is by allocating the APBN to provide social support for the community, especially the underprivileged groups. "In addition, a reduction in the money supply in developed countries could also put pressure on financial markets through the weakening of the rupiah, and risk rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he said.\par \par \uc2 He added that Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is able to continue a consistent trend of improvement. The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) in the first quarter of 2022 stated that the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  grew strongly by 5.01 percent (year to year).\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, according to Edy, was supported by increased domestic demand, maintained export performance, and vigorous \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity around Eid.\par \par \uc2 Read: Jokowi Claims \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Rising as Covid-19 Number Drops\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news
