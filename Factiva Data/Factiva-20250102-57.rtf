\par\par \b \uc2 Advertorial: Unlocking digitalization at the G20 in Indonesia\b0\par\par\uc2 879 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 As Indonesia gears up to host this year's \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  (G20) Summit, digital transformation is one top-of-mind priority to "Recover Together, Recover Stronger". World leaders have acknowledged the significant role digitalization can play in closing gaps in issues with socioeconomic impacts such as stagnating productivity, pressures resulting from climate change and inequality in access to work and healthcare readiness, to name a few.\par \par \uc2 Digitalization also will transform global economies in the short- to medium-term, delivering a projected US$13 trillion in value across the world by 2030. Indonesia's 202 million internet users already contributed $70 billion to its digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2021. With G20 member economies accounting for 60 percent of the world's total population and 75 percent of global trade, these world leaders are at the forefront of this global mission and need to continue leading by example.\par \par \uc2 However, several factors in the roadmap to digitalization continue to impede nations from realizing their full digital potential. As co-chair of the Business 20 (B20) Digitalization Task Force -- a group of business leaders assembled to develop and deliver \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  recommendations to the G20 countries, international organizations and institutions -- I have had the honor of diving deep into some of these roadblocks. The taskforce has explored how to tackle issues such as differing levels of readiness and connectivity across regions; poor digital infrastructure and the lack of relevant \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  frameworks to support wider digitalization; and the critical shortage of digital skills needed to support digital transformation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).\par \par \uc2 Powering the heart of the digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 : MSMEs\par \par \uc2 MSMEs are one of the most important pillars of any digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In Indonesia, for example, 64.2 million MSMEs are contributing 8.5 trillion Indonesian rupiah to the nation's GDP. They also provide employment for 97 percent of Indonesia's total workforce, of which more than 60 percent are women-owned. Making it simpler for these MSMEs to access and utilize digital technologies, such as cloud computing, without regulatory complexities, is crucial, as these are the businesses driving digital and financial inclusion.\par \par \uc2 In its 2022 G20 Presidency, Indonesia has reaffirmed its position as a digital trailblazer by declaring its commitment to an inclusive and collaborative digital transition. A key objective of Indonesia's 2022 G20 Presidency is bridging the digital divide and fostering inclusive digital transformation, to radically accelerate the integration of underprivileged citizens into the digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and recover stronger, together. Industry and government need to continue to collaborate on these objectives to increase access to digital skills and training across the region and around the world.\par \par \uc2 Digital technologies have already helped create more robust and inclusive business ecosystems even in remote parts of Indonesia. Peer-to-peer lending-platform Amartha serves entrepreneurs in Indonesia's rural areas, offering financial services to microbusinesses and targeting working-age mothers with dependents. Without access to the cloud-based analytics it uses to identify nonperforming loans, Amartha's reach would be limited, leaving many businesses without access to financial services.\par \par \uc2 Eyes on Indonesia to facilitate this important and complex global discussion\par \par \uc2 Indonesia was among the first in the world to recognize the power of digital transformation in sectoral economics. As ASEAN's leading producer of decacorn tech firms, valued at over $10 billion, Indonesia has proudly and successfully fostered a thriving, internationally competitive tech scene.\par \par \uc2 As it enters the next stage in its development, it is vital that Indonesia remains a champion of innovation by developing global and interoperable solutions to promoting the growth of local MSMEs. One example of this was the issuing of Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No.71 of 2019, which allowed local companies in Indonesia to access cloud computing more easily, with less regulatory \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Forward-thinking solutions and open stances on digital trade should be adopted to promote the organic development and regional scalability of local champions. The exposure to international resources and best practices will bolster MSMEs, helping them remain resilient, agile and adaptive to societal needs.\par \par \uc2 Beyond G20, Indonesia is also in a unique position of continuing the digitalization agenda into its ASEAN Chairmanship in 2023. In particular, we see an opportunity for Indonesia to demonstrate leadership and accelerate the timeline to launch negotiations on a high-standard and forward-leaning ASEAN Digital \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Framework Agreement.\par \par \uc2 The way forward for digitalization\par \par \uc2 The Business 20 (B20) Digitalization Task Force has developed robust recommendations for leaders meeting in Indonesia this year at the G20 and B20 Summits. These include unlocking digital opportunities by promoting the adoption and uptake of digital infrastructure-like cloud across both \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and private sectors; ensuring international regulatory coherence for digital policies including those that preserve free flow of data across borders; upskilling MSMEs with necessary digital and cybersecurity literacy; and defining interoperable cybersecurity standards based on international best practices.\par \par \uc2 A supportive regulatory environment is key to promoting digital infrastructure, facilitating the adoption of digital services and encouraging digital-ready nations. November's G20 and B20 Summits in Bali will be a critical platform for discussing the path forward and setting the tone on a digital transformation agenda that the G20 and B20 can carry forward into India's presidency in 2023, and beyond.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221110eiba0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

Ahead of the polls, the Republicans stood a great chance of sweeping both the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the Senate but eventually had to be content with a slim lead, ensuring the checks and balances mechanism will work properly. This is very healthy and constructive in a democracy.\par \par \uc2 A landslide victory for the Republicans would have been disastrous for the world's largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and military because it could allow the Republicans under former president \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  to reinvigorate his Make American Great Again campaign.\par \par \uc2 "It was a good day, I think, for democracy," US President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  told a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "And I think it was a good day for America [...] Our democracy has been tested in recent years, but with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are."\par \par \uc2 For Biden, the midterm elections looked like a referendum on his performance over the last two years. Now he can fly to Bali to attend the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  Summit on Nov. 15-16 in a much more confident mood.\par \par \uc2 Biden's presence in Bali will be heartening for President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  as the host of the summit, as he can hope the US President will play a more constructive role in the G20 meeting, which the world expects to produce concrete actions to cope with the multiple crises of energy, food, health, climate and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown.\par \par \uc2 For the Republicans, the failure to secure a majority is a flop. It is a disappointing outcome given that nearly all US media organizations and leading \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  opinion surveyors had predicted the US would swing heavily to the Republicans.\par \par \uc2 During his four-year presidency, Trump brought the US to the lowest rung of democracy, thanks to his dictatorial mindset and disrespect for international agreements. When Biden defeated him in the 2020 elections, Trump refused to concede his loss, saying the elections had been manipulated. He even encouraged his die-hard supporters to revolt and did not do enough to stop an attack on the Capitol Hill on Jan. 6, 2021.\par \par \uc2 Trump had been expected to announce his bid to contest the 2024 elections on Nov. 15 if the Republicans had gained majorities in the Senate and Congress.\par \par \uc2 So far, the Democrats have secured 48 seats in the Senate, as have the Republicans. But there will be a runoff in some states because neither party could pass the 50 percent threshold.\par \par \uc2 For Indonesia, the world's third-largest democracy after India and the US, the political developments in the US can teach a good lesson. Anyone who wants to manipulate democracy for their own interests will eventually confront the common sense of the voters.\par \par \uc2 American voters have proved their maturity in understanding the value of democracy, so will Indonesian voters who will elect their new leader in February 2024.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221110eiba0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - GoTo, the merger of ride-hailing provider Gojek and e-commerce Tokopedia (IDX: GOTO), reportedly planned to lay off 1,000 workers as a form of the company\u8217\'20\'19s financial efficiency.\par \par \uc2 As reported by \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2  on Friday, November 11, 2022, the number is equal to more than 10 percent of the workforce and will affect all divisions.\par \par \uc2 A Bloomberg source who wished to remain anonymous said that the Jakarta-based company, which also operates in Singapore and Vietnam, will announce staff cuts in the coming weeks. "The size of the reduction is subject to change," the source added.\par \par \uc2 GoTo representatives refused to comment when asked for confirmation. Previously, the company\u8217\'20\'19s executives said that the management was striving to balance \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  on growth with its effort to reach profitability.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2  source also stated that GoTo brought up the layoff plan in line with the plan to prepare quarterly performance results on November 21, 2022.\par \par \uc2 As of August 2022, GoTo reported that its second-quarter adjusted loss before interest, \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2 , depreciation and amortization widened to Rp4.14 trillion ($264 million) from a Pro-forma loss of Rp3.9 trillion a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 If the layoff is announced, GoTo will join tech giants such as \uc2 Meta Platforms Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . which also cut staff after years of expansion due to the increasingly \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The recent wave of layoffs in the technology industry is nearing the level of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

\par\par \b \uc2 A more progressive ASEAN under Jokowi's leadership\b0\par\par\uc2 1,098 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Kornelius Purba, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is slated to hand over ASEAN's rotary chairmanship to President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  at the closing ceremony of the regional grouping's three-day gathering in Phnom Penh tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 Many expect more progressive initiatives to flourish in ASEAN under Indonesia's leadership and that pending issues like the inclusion of Timor Leste as the bloc's 11th member will be settled.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  presidency, which will host its leaders' summit in Bali next week, will certainly strengthen President Jokowi's credentials among his regional peers. His ability to mobilize bolder measures against the ruthless Myanmar junta without giving an impression that Indonesia is dictating the group is another reason why he is worthy of the ASEAN leadership.\par \par \uc2 The ability of ASEAN to establish the world's largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  trade bloc, the \uc2 Regional Comprehensive \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Partnership\uc2  (\uc2 RCEP\uc2 ), is another testament to Indonesia's leadership. The \uc2 RCEP\uc2  accounts for 30 percent of the world's population, GDP and trade, turning it into the main driver of global growth for years to come.\par \par \uc2 When hosting the ASEAN Summit in November 2011, Indonesia, the region's largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , initiated the formation of the \uc2 RCEP\uc2  along with ASEAN's dialogue partners China, Japan, Australia, India and New Zealand. After eight years of negotiation, \uc2 RCEP\uc2  was officially approved by all the 10 members of ASEAN and five dialogue partners. India withdrew from the negotiations for domestic interests.\par \par \uc2 Other ASEAN dialogue partners such as the United States and Canada did not join the trade bloc. Back then US president Barack Obama was very ambitious about forming the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was clearly aimed at containing China's rise. Donald Trump took over from Obama in 2017 and immediately scrapped the TPP agreement without consulting other members, including Japan.\par \par \uc2 In the absence of the US, Japan and Australia tried to rebuild the TPP into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). But when Joe Biden took office in 2021, not only did he reject the new partnership scheme, he also proposed a new initiative called the Indo-Pacific \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Partnership (IPEF). It can be said IPEF has killed the CPTPP.\par \par \uc2 Following the ASEAN Summit on Friday, the regional leaders hold bilateral summits with their dialogue partners from China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia, the US and Canada on Saturday. Another meeting will be arranged between the ASEAN leaders and \uc2 United Nations\uc2  secretary general \uc2 Antonio Guterres\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, the Southeast Asian leaders will gather with all dialogue partners in the East Asian Summit. And after that is over, Hun Sen will hand over the ASEAN chairmanship to Jokowi, but the term will be effective only on Jan. 1, 2023.\par \par \uc2 There is little possibility that Hun Sen will repeat his 2013 stunt, when as the ASEAN chair he vetoed the decision of ASEAN leaders to voice their concern about China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. The PM removed the expression of concern from the final draft, triggering protests from other ASEAN leaders.\par \par \uc2 Hun Sen has sprung some surprises instead. He criticized Myanmar's military junta after it denied him access to the opposition figures in his capacity as the chair of ASEAN. When assuming the ASEAN chairmanship, Hun Sen had appeared to show flexibility to the military junta that toppled the democratically elected government of Aug San \uc2 Suu Kyi\uc2  in February 2021.\par \par \uc2 During the ASEAN summit President Jokowi is expected to push for much harsher actions against Myanmar junta leader Gen. Aung Min Hlaing. The ASEAN leaders should have the guts to temporarily suspend Myanmar's ASEAN membership until the military stops the atrocities against people in the country.\par \par \uc2 The regional leaders have barred the junta from attending official functions of ASEAN, but this punitive measure is almost meaningless in the goal offorcingthe junta to implement the five-point consensus, which would restore peace and bring the nation back on track fordemocracy.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  is also wondering if the ASEAN leaders will decide to invite representatives of ousted Myanmar leader \uc2 Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2 , including the National Unity Government (NUG), in future ASEAN meetings as a tough move to pressure the junta.\par \par \uc2 The summit this weekend may also see the ASEAN leaders call more strongly for China to do what it takes to complete negotiations on the nonbinding Code of Conduct on the South China Sea, simply because there has been progress in the talks about the high seas. China has claimed sovereignty over nearly the whole maritime territory, at the expense of other claimants Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia stakes no claim in the natural resources-rich waters, but several times, Chinese fishing boats were found poaching in Indonesian waters that they claim as their traditional fishing grounds. President Jokowi has on several occasions warned of zero tolerance for any violation of Indonesia's sovereignty. The waters could become a source of conflict or even limited military clashes in the future if no mutual understanding is reached.\par \par \uc2 Two days after the ASEAN meeting, Jokowi will preside over the G20 Summit in Bali. Indonesia is the only ASEAN state in the world's 20 largest economies, while East Asia is represented by China, Japan and South Korea. The two-day meeting in Bali is expected to feature discussions and debates on the food and energy crises facing the world, as well as imminent global recession.\par \par \uc2 Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China's threat to unify Taiwan through militarily actions and the nuclear threat spread by North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un will also highlight the conversations among the leaders.\par \par \uc2 After the G20 Summit, the region will host another world summit, the \uc2 Asia-Pacific \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Cooperation (APEC) \uc2 Summit, which will be hosted by Thai PM \uc2 Prayut Chan\uc2 -o-cha on Nov. 18-19. Indonesia has been active in APEC from the very beginning.\par \par \uc2 Another key foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  agenda item for Indonesia next year is to accelerate the implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, with ASEAN playing the central role. It will not be an easy undertaking because although many countries acknowledge the pivotal role of ASEAN, major powers like the US, China, Australia, India and Japan have their own concept about the Indo-Pacific.\par \par \uc2 Amid the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and political landscape, ASEAN can expect a more progressive leadership of Indonesia in addressing regional issues like the Myanmar crisis and world peace and stability. Godspeed.\par \par \uc2 ___________________\par \par \uc2 A senior editor at The Jakarta Post\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221111eibb0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Paving the way for peace in Ukraine\b0\par\par\uc2 970 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 M. Iftitah Sulaiman S , Hamburg, Germany\par \par \uc2 Hamburg was sunny yet cool on the morning of Nov. 4. It was 8 degrees Celsius and winds gusted through the German port city, sending chilly air through even the thickest of jackets. Yet the weather did not stop Indonesia's sixth president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) from continuing his journey to Bremen.\par \par \uc2 SBY felt optimistic. He had just communicated with Jakarta and received a clear message. His recommendation on Nov. 2 to President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  to accept Danilo Turk, president of Club de Madrid and former president of Slovenia, was approved.\par \par \uc2 SBY's recommendation was a follow-up to the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting of 40 former heads of state of government who are also members of the Club de Madrid in Berlin. Club de Madrid is the world's largest association for former heads of state and government in democratic countries.\par \par \uc2 They gathered in Berlin to find solutions to today's global problems. SBY himself initiated the forum, together with The Yudhoyono Institute, in collaboration with the Club de Madrid, the \uc2 German Ministry of Foreign Affairs\uc2  and the Liz Mhon Center.\par \par \uc2 The discussion, titled the Berlin \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Dialogue 2022, was warm and constructive, and the group agreed on five agendas.\par \par \uc2 First, the need to end the war in Ukraine, which has heated up the geopolitical situation, widely threatened international security and worsened the looming global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  shock.\par \par \uc2 Second, the need for reformation in the United Nations. Primarily, how to prevent excessive use of veto rights, which may hinder opportunities to solve global issues.\par \par \uc2 Third, overcoming food insecurity, which is contributing to the soaring inflation in many parts of the world today.\par \par \uc2 Fourth, solving energy insecurity, which includes scarcity in supply chains and increasing prices.\par \par \uc2 Fifth, finding solutions to skyrocketing debt around the world, especially in the least developed countries.\par \par \uc2 Club de Madrid believes the results from the Berlin meeting could be communicated both to the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  Leaders' Summit in Bali and to this year's \uc2 Group of Seven\uc2  presidency, Germany.\par \par \uc2 The results could also be shared in the \uc2 UN\uc2  Climate Change Conference (COP27) now underway in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. Last but not least, the recommendations should also be shared with the \uc2 UN\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Reading and observing the conclusion of the Berlin \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Dialogue 2022, it can be said the root of the problems confronting the world today is the war in Ukraine, which has lasted over eight months. This is not just a humanitarian tragedy, as thousands of lives have been lost on both sides and 15 million people fleeing Ukraine for safety.\par \par \uc2 The war in Ukraine has also created severe ramifications for the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and supply chains, especially of food and energy. Russia is shutting down its energy supplies to Europe, and as a result commodity prices are increasing rapidly. Likewise, the decline in exports of food commodities from Ukraine has resulted in food shortages.\par \par \uc2 Amid the global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  stemming from the Ukraine war, the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2  has several times raised \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Inevitably, US dollars are returning home. For countries facing maturity of debts in US dollars, this has stirred panic. Global debt is soaring.\par \par \uc2 The impact of the Ukraine war is flowing to Indonesia. Fuel prices are going up and inflation is increasing significantly, prompting stagflation. Employment is slowing and people's purchasing power is decreasing.\par \par \uc2 It is therefore unsurprising that the main recommendation of the Berlin dialogue is to end the war in Ukraine soon. Doing so would not only provide space and time for the world to resolve other socioeconomic problems, but also to prevent bigger crises from occurring, such as escalation of the conflict that will be more devastating to the world. Stopping the war in Ukraine will spare the world from the possibility of World War III.\par \par \uc2 We realize that hosting the G20 Summit is far from easy. Many G20 leaders still cling to their own "sectoral egos". The joint photo incident involving US Secretary of State \uc2 Antony Blinken\uc2 , who was reluctant to share the frame with Russian Foreign Minister \uc2 Sergey Lavrov\uc2  at the G20 ministerial meeting some time ago, needs our attention.\par \par \uc2 The likelihood of several parties resisting and rejecting the joint photo session at the upcoming G20 Summit is high. Yet politically, such symbolism is still necessary.\par \par \uc2 How can world leaders sit together, tone down their egos and discuss solutions to global issues if they are showing enmity? Of course, the photo session incident sent negative signals to the world regarding politics, diplomacy and the G20 event itself.\par \par \uc2 However, in every challenge lies opportunity. Indonesia plays a big role as the country holding the G20 presidency. This not only requires facilitating meetings between countries with an interest in the war in Ukraine, both bilateral and multilateral, but also encouraging all parties, including former heads of state and heads of government, to pursue a peace agreement in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia can learn from Potsdam, the historic site in Berlin where "the Big Three" world leaders from the US, United Kingdom and Russia gathered in 1945. They met to find solutions to World War II and to build a more prosperous world for everyone. The meeting resulted in an agreement to end the war and bring back peace.\par \par \uc2 We hope that the G20 Summit in Bali will be an inspiration for a better world in the future. The Berlin \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Dialogue 2022 has paved the way for peace in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Although it is a small step and there is still a long way to go, through the perseverance and patience of all parties, peace in Ukraine is not beyond our reach.\par \par \uc2 ________________\par \par \uc2 CEO of Romeo Strategic Consulting and special assistant to the Indonesian president 2011-2014.

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) has asked the \uc2 European Union\uc2  (EU) to increase cooperation with Indonesia and ASEAN for tackling multidimensional global crises, such as the food and energy crises as well as inflation.\par \par \uc2 "World conditions are not improving, we must face multidimensional crises, including the food crisis, energy crisis, and inflation. Only one option to deal with these challenges: cooperation," President Jokowi said during a meeting with European Council President \uc2 Charles Michel\uc2  on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Michel congratulated and lauded Indonesia for organizing G20 activities in the current \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  situation.\par \par \uc2 "The European Council fully supports Indonesia"s G20 Presidency," he said.\par \par \uc2 At the meeting, President Jokowi was accompanied by Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs, Mahfud MD; Coordinating Minister for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Affairs, \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2 ; Minister of Foreign Affairs, \uc2 Retno Marsudi\uc2 ; and State Secretary Minister Pratikno.\par \par \uc2 The bilateral meeting was one of the three on the agenda on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit on Saturday, in addition to meetings with the \uc2 UN\uc2  Secretary-General and executive chairman of the \uc2 World \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Forum\uc2  (\uc2 WEF\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Jokowi also attended a series of summits with ASEAN speech partners.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Italy, he had discussed global issues with Michel.

\par\par \b \uc2 Disney\uc2  Plans to Freeze Hiring, Cut Some Jobs\b0\par\par\uc2 510 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo.co\par \uc2 TEMPOE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is planning to freeze hiring and cut some jobs as it strives to move the \uc2 Disney\uc2 + streaming service to profitability against a backdrop of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday, Nov. 11.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive \uc2 Bob Chapek\uc2  sent the memo to \uc2 Disney\uc2 's leaders, saying the company is instituting a targeted hiring freeze and anticipates "some small staff reductions" as it looks to manage costs.\par \par \uc2 "While certain macroeconomic factors are out of our control, meeting these goals requires all of us to continue doing our part to manage the things we can control - most notably, our costs," Chapek wrote in the memo.\par \par \uc2 The move came after \uc2 Disney\uc2  missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings on Tuesday as the entertainment giant racked up more losses from its push into streaming video, which it refers to as its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business. Shares of the company fell more than 13% on Wednesday following its results.\par \par \uc2 Disney\uc2  has said the fast-growing service added 12 million subscribers in its \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  fourth quarter but reported an operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion. The company said \uc2 Disney\uc2 + would become profitable in \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  2024, with losses having peaked in the quarter.\par \par \uc2 The streaming service is known for original series including the "Star Wars" entries "The Mandalorian," "Andor" and "Obi-Wan Kenobi," the Marvel entries "WandaVision," "Hawkeye" and "She-Hulk: Attorney at Law," and content hubs for \uc2 Disney\uc2 , \uc2 Pixar\uc2 , Marvel and "Star Wars" films.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street analysts voiced concern about \uc2 Disney\uc2 's escalating streaming costs. MoffettNathanson analyst \uc2 Michael Nathanson\uc2  observed in a note this week that "the company has to prove that their pivot to DTC will be worth the investment price that is currently being paid."\par \par \uc2 Corporate America is making deep cuts to its employee base to brace for an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  downturn. \uc2 Meta Platforms\uc2  (META.O) said this week it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce to rein in costs.\par \par \uc2 One of \uc2 Disney\uc2 's studio peers, \uc2 Warner Bros Discovery\uc2 , has undergone dramatic cost-cutting efforts, including layoffs, as the recently merged company restructures its content operations.\par \par \uc2 Chapek said \uc2 Disney\uc2  has established a task force, including Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Christine McCarthy\uc2  and General Counsel Horacio Gutierrez, to help him make "critical big-picture decisions."\par \par \uc2 The company already has begun looking at content and marketing \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but Chapek said the cuts would not sacrifice quality. Hiring will be limited to a small subset of critical positions, and some staff reductions are anticipated, as the company looks to make itself more cost-efficient, Chapek wrote.\par \par \uc2 Chapek said business travel would be limited and trips would require advance approval, or be conducted virtually as much as possible.\par \par \uc2 "Our transformation is designed to ensure we thrive not just today, but well into the future," Chapek wrote.\par \par \uc2 The memo was first reported by CNBC.\par \par \uc2 REUTERS\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo in Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/08/24/id_1135544/1135544_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020221112eibc0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 A Tough Challenge After the Growth\b0\par\par\uc2 682 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 WHILE global financial markets are shaking with \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , optimism is spreading in Indonesia. That optimism stems from the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth statistic published on November 7. As of the end of Q3-2022, Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  grew 5.72 percent year-on-year. Government officials cheerfully boasted about Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience in the midst of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, the financial market showed a lukewarm response. In fact, the growth statistic did nothing to slow down the rupiah\u8217\'20\'19s decline. By the end of that day, the rupiah depreciated to Rp15,685 per US dollar compared to Rp15,600 on the Jakarta market opening. The rupiah only appreciated quickly after another statistic was released two days later. And it was not about the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but rather about inflation in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Defying market predictions, inflation in the United States as of October slowed to 7.7 percent, down from 8.2 in the previous month. Decelerating inflation in the US gave hope that the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  will not so aggressively raise \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the coming months. The financial market got a shot of euphoria. The news electrified the rupiah, which rapidly rallied back. By the end of the week, Friday, November 11, the rupiah exchange rate returned to around Rp15,500 per US dollar.\par \par \uc2 Such is reality. The rise and fall of the rupiah is more dependent on inflation in the US and the Fed\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  than Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth statistics. In other words, capital movement in the financial market has more power over the rupiah\u8217\'20\'19s fate than real \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  movements. The inflow and outflow of dollars through portfolio investment in the financial market happen more rapidly. Therefore, the rupiah\u8217\'20\'19s movements are more affected by sentiments that take hold in the financial market rather than how good the growth statistic looks.\par \par \uc2 Certainly, \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth remains a crucial indicator. It shows how well\u8212\'20\'14or how poorly\u8212\'20\'14an \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  performs in a certain period. For politicians, growth statistics are the determinant yardstick, a report of a success or a failure. Meanwhile, to investors in the financial market, growth statistics are merely a reference about past performance. When moving their money, investors in the market will consider the future and how the projected yields of investments will turn out. Future performance is more important. What\u8217\'20\'19s next? That is the most important question to answer.\par \par \uc2 So, once the euphoria lets up, analysts would be concentrating on US inflation once again, studying its movements. Is inflation truly past its zenith and will continue to slowly fall until it goes under the Fed\u8217\'20\'19s target of only two percent? Considering the fact that US inflation is still 7.7 percent, it seems to be a long way ahead. If it wishes to push inflation down below the target, the Fed will not be stopping with its rate hikes for the foreseeable future.\par \par \uc2 Currently, the Fed\u8217\'20\'19s interest rate is still at four percent. Meanwhile, on the meeting in early November, Fed Chair \uc2 Jerome Powell\uc2  already gave the signal that the Fed will slow down with the rate hikes, but the peak will be higher compared to the previous target of 4.6 percent. In conclusion, the financial market must still anticipate a few more rate hikes until that target is reached.\par \par \uc2 To Indonesia, this poses a tough challenge to maintain growth. High \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  will bring about a global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown, driving down demand for various export commodities from Indonesia. The risk can be even bigger if the demand slump happens to labor-intensive manufactured goods, such as textiles or footwear. A weak export market for labor-intensive industries can end up in massive layoffs.\par \par \uc2 This magazine reports this week that en masse layoffs in the labor-intensive industries are already happening. It might continue to do so in the coming months. Investors are certainly keeping an eye on this bleak possibility. To them, there is no point in being distracted by the glory of past statistics.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/13/815763/815763_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020221114eibd0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Executive column: \uc2 Cathay Pacific\uc2  eyes ASEAN cargo potential\b0\par\par\uc2 838 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 Airlines in Southeast Asia have enjoyed a strong recovery since the start of the year and are rushing to offer more flights to meet a rebound in demand for passenger services--and take advantage of an unexpected boost from cargo.\par \par \uc2 Dominic Perret, \uc2 Cathay Pacific\uc2 's regional general manager Southeast Asia & Southwest Pacific, spoke with The Jakarta Post's Vincent Fabian Thomas on Oct. 31 to discuss challenges and opportunities the airline industry is facing in this region.\par \par \uc2 Question: What is your view on the recovery of the airline industry in the ASEAN region?\par \par \uc2 Answer: I'm pretty bullish on ASEAN as a whole. There is big pent-up demand for travel, and I think we'll see a strong recovery. Many countries in this region have made significant changes to their policies and pivoted toward living with COVID-19 and started to open up.\par \par \uc2 We are adding flights again across ASEAN, like in Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia. We have some places that we are waiting to relaunch, like Bali, Phuket and Penang. The latter is currently just for cargo, because we do not have passenger flights for now.\par \par \uc2 But there's the situation in Hong Kong as well. [For us, the pandemic] impact has lasted a bit longer, because Hong Kong's restrictions have lasted a little bit longer.\par \par \uc2 Hong Kong has made a number of positive changes to its policies in recent months, but we hope the opening continues and we can return to a situation like before the pandemic, when people could enter freely and from day one, you could straightaway go to restaurants, Disneyland.\par \par \uc2 How does \uc2 Cathay\uc2  view the Indonesian market and its tourist destinations?\par \par \uc2 Inbound wise, there is very strong tourism potential in Indonesia. Bali is very popular in Hong Kong and Europe, and I know there's so much more that many of us haven't seen yet. Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is growing, and it will become more important as a business destination as well.\par \par \uc2 Outbound wise, there is this middle class, which increases as people start to have more disposable income. We can see demand for travel increasing as well.\par \par \uc2 Jakarta is a very important destination for foreign domestic workers [flying] into Hong Kong, as well as seamen returning to Indonesia. We will be back to two flights per day by January, although that is still lower than the pre-pandemic three to four flights per day.\par \par \uc2 Before COVID-19, we flew to Medan, North Sumatra, as well, but Bali is really the key destination for tourism. Starting on Nov. 27, we will have one flight a day to Bali, which is the same level as pre-pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Anything that makes it easier for people to visit Bali and other destinations, either as a tourist or for a business, is going to be beneficial for aviation.\par \par \uc2 How do you assess the cargo business potential of this region?\par \par \uc2 I see this as the other big opportunity in ASEAN. We have seen a very strong cargo performance out of ASEAN in the last two or three years.\par \par \uc2 It has been a very important part of our business. Over the last two years, cargo has sustained us. 2021 was our record cargo year, with a very significant increase compared to before the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 We are seeing a lot of investment--domestic and foreign--into ASEAN, and I see a strong potential for the cargo business throughout the whole region.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, Vietnam was very strong. This year, Malaysia is performing very well. Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines are also important markets.\par \par \uc2 What are your plans and strategies for this region?\par \par \uc2 In the short term, it's really about growing our flight frequencies and trying to get back toward pre-COVID level. Once we get back, we can start to think about expansion.\par \par \uc2 That involves restarting some flights within ASEAN and then adding capacity back to those destinations.\par \par \uc2 Obviously, we're focused on Hong Kong, but we also aim further. Hong Kong is a very good hub to sell flights to Northeast Asia, like Japan, South Korea and China, as well as United States West Coast and Canada. So, we are making sure that those connections can be very convenient by investing in the customer and digital experience.\par \par \uc2 In the ASEAN region, Singapore, Jakarta, Bangkok and Manila are among the places that have strong business, tourism and cultural connections with Hong Kong, and those are key cities in ASEAN.\par \par \uc2 Will rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  and high inflation affect your projection or the way you approach next year?\par \par \uc2 In recent months, as restrictions have been lifted, we've seen some good rebound in demand for traveling. On the other hand, there's thiseconomic \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , so those two forces, I guess, will be interacting with each other.\par \par \uc2 What we have to do as a company is to make sure that we are very aware of the current situation and talking about being agile; you have to respond to the market.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221113eibd00005\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 The Impending Layoff Storm\b0\par\par\uc2 2,306 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022.

Including Diki\u8212\'20\'14not his real name\u8212\'20\'14as well as other Kahatex employees. Although the textile and garment factory in Cimanggung, Sumedang Regency, West Java, has not laid off its employees, its workers\u8217\'20\'19 hours have already been cut.\par \par \uc2 According to Diki, Kahatex employees normally work 11 days and have one day off. But, over the past three months, they have worked 10 days on and two days off. The problem is, Diki now only receives Rp1.5 million for two weeks of work. \u8220\'20\'1CBefore, the pay was Rp1.75 million per two weeks,\u8221\'20\'1D said the man who has worked at Kahatex for two years on Thursday, November 10.\par \par \uc2 Diki heard that a number of workers have been furloughed until an unspecified time. \u8220\'20\'1CThey say (the workers) will be summoned again (to work).\u8221\'20\'1D As far as Diki and other employees know, work hours are reduced and workers have been suspended because textile exports have dropped.\par \par \uc2 Kahatex indeed relies on exports. The company is among the largest integrated textile companies. Besides Sumedang, Kahatex also has factories in Cijerah, City of Bandung; and Solokan Jeruk, Majalaya, Bandung Regency, all in West Java, with over 48,000 employees. On its official website, Kahatex claims the company has exported over 40 percent of its products to 80 countries. Some indirect exports are performed through garment, sock, and sweater manufacturers.\par \par \uc2 Kahatex garment factory in Cimahi, West Java. kaha.com\par \par \uc2 Head of the West Java Manpower and Transmigration Office, Rachmat Taufik Garsadi, said Kahatex initially wanted to reduce its employees by not extending their contracts, but the plan was cancelled. Kahatex\u8217\'20\'19s management instead decided to cut work hours. \u8220\'20\'1CSix days a week at first. Now, workers have Saturdays off but are still paid 65 percent of the wage they\u8217\'20\'19re supposed to earn on those days,\u8221\'20\'1D said Rachmat.\par \par \uc2 Kahatex Compliance Manager Tamami assured that there have been no mass layoffs at the Cimanggung factory. \u8220\'20\'1COnly some contracts were not extended. This applied to employees whose contracts have ended and with poor performance,\u8221\'20\'1D he said on Wednesday, November 9.\par \par \uc2 But the news that some employees have been suspended has caused Kahatex employees to feel restless. Sandi\u8212\'20\'14not his real name\u8212\'20\'14who is a Kahatex employee, said every month there are reports about employees at a division who are suspended in rotation. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s non-discriminatory, both permanent and contract employees get their turn,\u8221\'20\'1D said the 30-year-old man.\par \par \uc2 The West Java office and transmigration office received a report from the Indonesian Employer Association (Apindo) that as many as 87 percent of companies have laid off their employees as of September. And 43,567 people experienced job cuts.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Indonesian Textile Association (API) reports that over 50,000 people have been furloughed and laid off. \u8220\'20\'1CThe data are very dynamic, they change according to the worsening situation,\u8221\'20\'1D said API General Chairman, Jemmy Kartiwa Sastraatmaja, on Saturday, November 12. According to him, in such conditions, the first to be laid off are workers with term-based work agreements.\par \par \uc2 Coordinating Minister for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Airlangga Hartarto in Batam, Riau Islands, November 4. ANTARA/Teguh Prihatna\par \par \uc2 Coordinating Minister for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2  admitted the potential for mass layoffs in labor-intensive industries, including the textile sector. According to the minister, the economies of Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s trade partners have slowed down, causing the demand for exports to drop. \u8220\'20\'1CDemand has declined in the United States and Europe,\u8221\'20\'1D he said on Monday, November 7. As a result, excess supply and goods already manufacture were accumulating. Because of this, many companies have suffered and have had to cut expenses by suspending or laying off employees.\par \par \uc2 The business slump has not only impacted textile companies that export their products. General Chairman of the Indonesian Fiber and Filament Association (APSyFI), Redma Gita Wiraswasta, said factories that focus on serving domestic demand have also been shaken due to a domestic oversupply. Goods not absorbed by the export market have entered the domestic market. Meanwhile, domestic demand has declined due to inflation and a weakened purchasing power.\par \par \uc2 The main entrance to the Kahatex textile factory in Rancaekek, Bandung Regency, West Java, November 10. TEMPO/Aminuddin\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, imported textile products in the form of garment and clothing are flowing from overseas. The APSyFI received information that the government has issued import license to several importers for 300,000 tons of textile. \u8220\'20\'1CThe permit was issued in July and will be in effect until December 2022,\u8221\'20\'1D said Redma. \u8220\'20\'1CAround 40 percent has come in.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Members of the association are feeling the slump in the textile industry, both the downstream and upstream sector. One company and member of the association in Tangerang, Banten, has only been operating at 65 percent of the factory\u8217\'20\'19s 5,400-ton manufacturing capacity over the past two months. Around 10 percent of the 800 workers have been sent home. If the condition continues, the owner will stop operations. \u8220\'20\'1CThe plan is for an overhaul, maintenance,\u8221\'20\'1D said Tito, the factory owner. He said he is forced to move up the initial maintenance schedule of March 2023. The routine maintenance, held every two to three years, was supposed to be done during the end of fasting month Idul Fitri holidays next year, after the \u8216\'20\'18great harvest\u8217\'20\'19 for textile factories.\par \par \uc2 Workers produce shoes for export in Tangerang, Banten, April 2019. ANTARA/Akbar Nugroho Gumay/File Photo\par \par \uc2 Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have also felt the slump. According to Cisatex Director, Agus Ruslan, the Majalaya sarong center in Bandung Regency should be busy preparing its supply for next year\u8217\'20\'19s Idul Fitri. Cisatex is a sarong textile manufacturer. \u8220\'20\'1CFrom us, the buzz shifts to sewing SMEs. Two months before Idul Fitri, the crowds centered at traders,\u8221\'20\'1D he said on Friday, November 4.\par \par \uc2 But instead of manufacturing sarong textile, the Cisatex factory has stopped operating for one week as there have been no orders. \u8220\'20\'1CWe manufacture to order. If we continue manufacturing without anyone buying, what\u8217\'20\'19s the use?\u8221\'20\'1D lamented Agus. He only turned on his machines on Tuesday, November 8. \u8220\'20\'1CBut the order wasn\u8217\'20\'19t large.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Agus described the textile slump using his electricity bill as an indicator. During normal conditions, Cisatex pays an average electricity bill of Rp13 million per month. Now, the electricity bill comes to Rp2.5 million, sometimes Rp3.5 million per month,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. Cisatex employees now only work every three days. \u8220\'20\'1CBefore, the wage is paid after six days of work. Now, after three days they\u8217\'20\'19re paid because there hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been a lot of demand,\u8221\'20\'1D Agus added. Under such conditions, said Agus, his factory is still faring quite well. Many other small textile factories have closed shop.\par \par \uc2 A worker operates a weaving machine at a textile factory in Majalaya, Bandung Regency, West Java, in March. TEMPO/Prima Mulia\par \par \uc2 With a projected slow market during Idul Fitri, Agus is casting his hope at the 2024 presidential and regional head elections. \u8220\'20\'1CSome people have come and made contact. Just asking about our prices.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The footwear sector is not doing better. The Indonesian Footwear Producers Association (Aprisindo) General Chairman, Eddy Widjanarko, claimed as many as 25,700 workers from eight companies have either had their contracts discontinued or have been laid off due to the weakening global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Workers in the export-oriented footwear industry come to 523,750 people. Hundreds of other companies have had to send employees off, cancel outsourcing contracts, and created a 50-percent timework rotation scenario.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 A MEETING led by acting Director-General of the Chemical, Pharmaceutical, and Textile Department of the Industry Ministry, Ignatius Warsito, on Friday, October 28, was rife with tension. The host had invited owners of major Indonesian textile companies, such as Kahatex, Pan Brothers, Busana Apparel Group, Pouchen Group, Wangta Agung, Berkat Ganda, Young Tree Industries, and Venamon, as well as footwear and textile association leaders.\par \par \uc2 A worker checks the quality of shoes made at the Aerostreet Footwear Factory in Wonosari, Klaten, Central Java, April 2021. ANTARA/Aloysius Jarot Nugroho/File Photo\par \par \uc2 Redma Gita Wiraswasta of the APSyFI, who attended the meeting, challenged Warsito to visit factories that had stopped operating. At the time, around 20,000 workers had been sent home. Businesses had already informed the ministry of the issue, but there had been no response. Finally, news about workers sent home and mass layoffs became a hot media topic.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPak Warsito was a bit angry, complained, why were the layoffs blown up by the media,\u8221\'20\'1D said Redma of the incident around three weeks ago. Industry players, he said, were also upset because Warsito was questioning the validity of the data on layoffs.\par \par \uc2 According to Redma, the industry ministry was referring to data that showed a 8.09-percent growth (year-on-year) in the textile and textile product sector until the third semester this year. Exports had reached a growth of 15.6 percent as of September. The industry ministry also referred to its visit to Asia Pacific Rayon\u8217\'20\'19s factory, which was still fully operating. But, Redma explained, the company was able to fully operate without dismissing employees because it had expanded its warehouse in order to accommodate its goods.\par \par \uc2 When asked to confirm, Warsito refused to provide an explanation. The interview scheduled for Friday, November 11, was cancelled only several minutes ahead of schedule. \u8220\'20\'1C(We) need prior coordination because the issue is sensitive,\u8221\'20\'1D said a member of the minister\u8217\'20\'19s staff.\par \par \uc2 The industry ministry is not the only ministry with doubts about data from industry players. Acting Head of the Finance Ministry\u8217\'20\'19s Macro-\b \highlight22\uc2 economy Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Center, Abdurohman, said textile exports, specifically of products with Harmonized System 61 and 62 codes, i.e., clothing and accessories, still had massive growth in the third quarter of 2022. \u8220\'20\'1CThis shows that the textile industry\u8217\'20\'19s performance is still good,\u8221\'20\'1D he said at a media gathering in Bogor, West Java, on Friday, November 4.\par \par \uc2 According to Abdurohman, textile companies and garment factories were also still showing solid financial performances, based on sales and earnings, in particular in the first and second trimesters. Sale growth in the textile sector was even higher than growth in the manufacturing sector. Abdurohman said the textile sector had a growth of 10 percent while the manufacturing sector only enjoyed an around 5-percent growth. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a bit confusing, if layoffs are indeed happening.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But, on Monday, November 7, Coordinating Minister for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2  confirmed the reports from business about potential layoffs. He said the phenomenon is due to the weakening of \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in importing countries, causing demand to drop in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 In a work meeting with the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 (DPR) Manpower Commission on Tuesday, November 8, Manpower Minister Ida Fauziyah said as of September, 10,675 workers had been laid off. To mitigate the layoffs, said Ida, her ministry has met with businesses. \u8220\'20\'1CIf layoffs are unavoidable, the rights of workers must be met,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 According to Ida, other efforts can be done by companies to prevent layoffs, for example, by reducing the salaries of directors and managers, reducing work hours and work days, eliminating overtime, sending workers home in rotation, not extending expired worker contracts, and providing pension for workers who qualify. These are in line with the Manpower and Transmigration Minister\u8217\'20\'19s Circular No. 907/2004, said the minister.\par \par \uc2 Even so, Ida claimed that open unemployment has declined from 6.94 percent last year to 5.8 percent in August. During the same time period, job opportunities have increased to 4.25 million.\par \par \uc2 After the layoffs were acknowledged, the discussion forum for businesses and the coordinating ministry for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  on the morning of Friday, November 11, went more smoothly. Several echelon II officials from the finance ministry, industry ministry, trade ministry, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  representatives, as well as leaders of several business associations attended the hybrid online-offline meeting.\par \par \uc2 Representatives from \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  gave an explanation on global macro-\b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Several developed countries, such as the United States, \uc2 European Union\uc2  member states, and China, are showing a declining \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth. A high global inflation, along with disruptions in supply chains, have pushed many central banks to raise \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which in turn has triggered the global market\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  index. The global market turbulence has impacted domestic industries.\par \par \uc2 The around three-hour-meeting did not come up with any real solution. In line with Airlangga\u8217\'20\'19s earlier statement, the government said it would observe and assess field conditions in order to find a solution to prevent massive layoffs. \u8220\'20\'1CThe government will take actions like the Covid-19 mitigation efforts, where special policies may be issued, including possible loan restructuring,\u8221\'20\'1D said Airlangga.\par \par \uc2 In fact, businesses had already sounded the alarm in July. Aprisindo General Chairman Eddy Widjanarko said he had already communicated his industry\u8217\'20\'19s troubles to the industry ministry. \u8220\'20\'1CBut because there was no information yet about layoffs, it was more a signal warning about the potential impacts of a weakening global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But, when demand began to drop, worker contracts were not renewed, and workers were laid off, the government then busied itself in lobbying businesses, which were asked not to perform mass layoffs. At the same time, said Eddy, Aprisindo predicts that the drop in the demand for footwear will continue until December, and even until the first semester of 2023. \u8220\'20\'1CIt may decline to 50 percent,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. Once that happens, who will be able to prevent the layoff storm?\par \par \uc2 RETNO SULISTYOWATI, FACHRI REZA, WARISATUL ANBIYA, AMINUDDIN A.S.

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: Sustaining Indonesia's growth amid global  \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 1,035 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Reny Eka Putri, Mandiri, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  remains solid amid higher global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It grew by 5.72 percent in third quarter of the year compared to the same period last year, exceeding the growth in the second quarter of 5.44 percent. This growth is mainly supported by export performance and household consumption.\par \par \uc2 Government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , on the other hand, contracted. The government can increase \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the fourth quarter by ensuring sufficient revenue to finance expenditures until the end of the year. With regard to sources of growth, the manufacturing industry was the most significant contributor to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the third quarter, with a share of 17.88 percent.\par \par \uc2 By sector, the transportation and warehousing sector had the highest growth of 25.81 percent, followed by the accommodation and food and beverage sector, which grew by 17.83 percent compared to the third quarter of 2021.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's third-quarter \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance confirms our Mandiri Leading \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Index (MLEI), which suggested the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  would grow faster than in the second quarter of this year. The MLEI is a composite index that seeks to predict the movement of GDP in the next quarter. That can be useful as an early warning of trends in the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The MLEI's performance so far is quite representative of the direction of GDP movement, and we forecast that Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will grow moderately in the fourth quarter of 2022.\par \par \uc2 In 2022, the average MLEI in the second quarter of 101.1 was higher than the average MLEI in the first quarter of 100.9, so it predicted that the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  would grow more in the third quarter than in the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 In addition, results from the \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  Business Activity Survey show that business activity in the third quarter of 2022 remained strong. Higher growth was reflected by the weighted net balance (WNB) of 13.89 percent in the third quarter of 2022.\par \par \uc2 The increase in business activity was mainly supported by the performance of the mining and quarrying sector, in line with rising commodity prices and followed by the performance of the financial, real estate, mining industries and company services sectors. In line with more robust business performance, the average production capacity utilization also increased in the third quarter.\par \par \uc2 Despite the complex challenges of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , both externally and domestically, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 and the government are committed to strengthening coordination to maintain macroeconomic stability and promote \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth. Since the beginning of 2022, the government has taken a \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  focus on post-pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery and structural reforms.\par \par \uc2 The first steps include encouraging vaccination programs and health protocols so that community mobility and business activities will begin to run normally with fewer cases.\par \par \uc2 From the social side, community protection, \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  and support for the business world also continued to assist small and medium-scale businesses. The government continues to maintain the momentum of structural reforms to increase competitiveness and production capacity through \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  transformation.\par \par \uc2 In line with the government \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , BI strives to maintain financial system stability through monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . BI also strengthened its \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix response to preserve stability and momentum for \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery by strengthening monetary operations and increasing the interest rate structure on the money market.\par \par \uc2 This \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is in line with the increase in the BI 7-day reverse repo rate (BI7DRRR) benchmark interest rate to reduce overshot inflation expectations.\par \par \uc2 BI also strengthens the stabilization of the rupiah exchange rate by staying in the market as part of efforts to control inflation, mainly imported inflation, through triple interventions and operation twist policies.\par \par \uc2 In addition, international cooperation with central banks and other partner country authorities is encouraged so that exchange rate depreciation is not too deep and United States dollar exposure is not too dominant.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  prospects will continue to be influenced by the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and increasingly tight financial conditions. \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  and monetary policies are expected to control inflation and encourage \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and exchange rate stability.\par \par \uc2 However, several external risks will still challenge national macroeconomic stability in 2022 and 2023, especially the increasing volatility in global financial markets influenced by the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown, inflation and rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Several precautions should be taken to minimize the risk.\par \par \uc2 In financial markets, the volatility of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar increased due to expectations of rising inflation/core inflation, and US \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This condition is predicted to continue until 2023, or until inflation starts to slow down.\par \par \uc2 As of the end of the third quarter of this year, the rupiah had depreciated 6.8 percent to 15,228 against the greenback, when compared to the position at the beginning of the year.\par \par \uc2 The weakening of the rupiah was mainly influenced by capital flight that occurred in line with the continued hawkish \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the Fed.\par \par \uc2 We still maintain that the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar will reach 15,186 by the end of 2022.\par \par \uc2 We also see a potential surplus in the current account of 0.45 percent of GDP supported by improved performance in trade in goods and services.\par \par \uc2 Investor confidence also increased in line with the strong position of Indonesia's foreign exchange \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The position of Indonesia's foreign exchange \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  was recorded at US$130.2 billion as of October 2022 and is still able to strengthen the external sector's resilience and maintain the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 's sustainability.\par \par \uc2 We hope Indonesia's domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can still grow solidly in 2022 and 2023 amid the potential global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  downturn. We estimate that the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will reach 5.17 percent in 2022, supported by strong domestic fundamentals, improved quality of government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  and increased consumption, investment and export performance.\par \par \uc2 Optimism also came from several global institutions. The latest \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  report said the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was still surviving the global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 IMF\uc2  expects the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to grow by 5.3 percent in 2022 and 5 percent in 2023. Meanwhile, global growth is predicted to be only 2.4 percent in 2022 and 1.6 percent in 2023.\par \par \uc2 _________________\par \par \uc2 Senior quantitative analyst at \uc2 Bank Mandiri\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221115eibf00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Yuni Arisandy Sinaga\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - \uc2 APEC\uc2  member economies are ramping up efforts to revitalize cross-border travel by tackling lingering \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  faced by travelers even as the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year.\par \par \uc2 Through a report developed by the APEC \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Support Unit, \uc2 APEC\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Safe Passage Taskforce put forward recommendations to drive the forum\u8217\'20\'19s work on passenger movements in the region, looking into issues at and behind the border that can be addressed to facilitate travel and tourism in the region, according to a release issued by the APEC Safe Passage Taskforce on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 According to the report, international tourist arrivals to APEC economies fell by 79.1 percent in 2020 relative to 2019, which is higher than the 69.8-percent contraction registered in the rest of the world.\par \par \uc2 While the rest of the world saw an increase of 18.4 percent in tourist arrivals between 2020 and 2021, arrivals in the APEC region continued to decline by 28.3 percent during the same period.\par \par \uc2 "Safe passage coordination between member economies needs to continue even when the pandemic becomes endemic," Thailand\u8217\'20\'19s APEC Senior Official and the chair of the taskforce, Cherdchai Chaivaivid, stated.\par \par \uc2 "Beyond COVID-19, we need to come together and build that resilience in the face of future pandemics or crises that may affect cross-border travel," Cherdchai remarked.\par \par \uc2 He emphasized that travel and tourism are key to \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth of the Asia-Pacific region, so facilitating the safe resumption of cross-border movements will continue to feature post-pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Since its inception earlier this year, the taskforce has been exchanging best practices on the safe resumption of cross-border travel at the domestic, sub-regional, and regional levels.\par \par \uc2 It has worked towards greater alignment of approaches across \uc2 APEC\uc2 , for instance, through \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  discussions on facilitating travel for air and maritime crew as well as improved interoperability of vaccine certificates issued by \uc2 APEC\uc2  economies.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, \uc2 APEC\uc2  trade ministers welcomed the Voluntary Principles for the Interoperability of Vaccination Certificates in the APEC Region during their meeting in Bangkok in May.\par \par \uc2 The voluntary principles encourage members to recognize vaccination certificates issued by other \uc2 APEC\uc2  economies as proof of an individual\u8217\'20\'19s COVID-19 vaccination status for cross-border entry and use within borders.\par \par \uc2 "Containing COVID-19 through widespread and equitable access to vaccines is still the most important prerequisite to safely reopen borders and resume travel and tourism in the region," Emmanuel San Andres, a senior analyst with the \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Support Unit, stated.\par \par \uc2 Andres accentuated the need to strike a balance between policies that save lives and policies that enable \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity and people-to-people connectivity.\par \par \uc2 "Key to finding this sweet spot is ensuring that border policies are based on the best \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  health science and empirical data," he stated.\par \par \uc2 The report also emphasizes the importance of providing clear information to travelers about entry requirements relating to COVID-19. The information needs to be up-to-date, and access should be easy.\par \par \uc2 Thailand recently launched a one-stop information hub that highlights the summary of health and COVID-related border measures across \uc2 APEC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The report highlighted that regional mobility issues are cross-cutting and involve several ministries.\par \par \uc2 It recommends member economies to continue coordination and cooperation and develop a mechanism that is flexible, ready, and quick in order to immediately respond to future risks to cross-border mobility.\par \par \uc2 (T.Y012/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 16-11-2022 13:35:36\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221116eibg000b6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 G20 Vows to Calibrate Pace of Interest Rate Hikes\b0\par\par\uc2 539 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo.co\par \uc2 TEMPOE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Nusa Dua - Leaders of the world's biggest economies in the G20 Summit agreed to pace their interest rate hikes carefully to avoid spillovers and warned of "increased volatility" in currency moves, a sea change from last year's focus on mending the scars of the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 In a leaders' declaration signed on Wednesday, Nov. 16, the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  (G20) members said the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was facing "unparalleled multidimensional crises" ranging from the war in Ukraine to a surge in inflation, which are forcing many central banks to tighten monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "G20 central banks ... are closely monitoring the impact of price pressures on inflation expectations and will continue to appropriately calibrate the pace of monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  tightening in a data-dependent and clearly communicated manner," said the statement signed after a two-day G20 summit held in Bali.\par \par \uc2 The central banks will also be mindful of the need to limit spillovers, the statement added, in a nod to emerging economies' concerns about the potential for huge capital outflows if aggressive U.S. rate hikes continue.\par \par \uc2 "\b \highlight22\uc2 Central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  independence is crucial to achieving these goals and buttressing monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  credibility," it added.\par \par \uc2 The emphasis on the need to fight inflation contrasted with the G20 statement last year, which said central banks must avoid overreacting to transitory rises in inflation.\par \par \uc2 The G20 leaders also called for "temporary and targeted" \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  for low-income households which are particularly vulnerable to rising living costs. Last year, the leaders warned against any premature withdrawal of support to ensure the global recovery remained intact.\par \par \uc2 The shift in tone underscores the rapid change in the global environment and policymakers' priorities, caused in large part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.\par \par \uc2 An abrupt, sharp rise in inflation, driven by increasing commodity and fuel costs, caught many central banks off guard and forced them to shift gears toward rapid monetary tightening.\par \par \uc2 Now, policymakers are faced with the dilemma of having to combat inflation with interest rate hikes, without cooling economies that are already facing the risk of recession.\par \par \uc2 The head of the \uc2 World Trade Organization (WTO) \uc2 warned of the risk of various \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  clouding the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook.\par \par \uc2 "It may not happen everywhere, but several key countries risk sliding into recession," said \uc2 WTO\uc2  Director-General \uc2 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Of course, the impact of that can be quite significant for emerging markets and poor countries, which need external demand from the developed countries to recover," she told Reuters.\par \par \uc2 Aggressive rate hikes by the \uc2 U.S. Federal Reserve\uc2  have already jolted financial markets by causing a broad-based rise in the dollar, forcing countries like Japan to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stem sharp declines in their currencies.\par \par \uc2 In Wednesday's declaration, the G20 members reaffirmed their commitment to avoid excessive currency volatility. It also included a phrase recognizing that many currencies have "moved significantly this year with increased volatility."\par \par \uc2 Tokyo authorities have justified their yen-buying intervention as aimed at smoothing what they saw as excessively volatile moves in the currency.\par \par \uc2 REUTERS\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/11/16/id_1157486/1157486_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020221116eibg000b5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Advertorial: Rejuvenating Indonesia's investment climate amid global crises\b0\par\par\uc2 744 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 Amid an increasingly dynamic global situation, the Indonesian government has noted the important contribution of investment toward the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , in particular its commitment to improve competitiveness and investment climate for both local and foreign investment through the Job Creation Law, as ratified in 2020 under President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2 's administration.\par \par \uc2 According to data published by the Investment Ministry Coordinating Board (BKPM), an investment of US$2.45 to $2.47 trillion is needed for the 2020-2024 period to achieve the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2 -growth rate of 6 percent.\par \par \uc2 January through September 2022 saw domestic direct investment of Rp 413.1 trillion, while the same period saw foreign direct investment of Rp 479.3 trillion.\par \par \uc2 Under the new Job Creation Law, widely known as "the Omnibus Law", the Indonesian government opened the majority of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sector to 100 percent foreign investment. Consisting of 186 articles, the Omnibus Law summarizes 77 laws which are divided into 11 clusters, including ease of doing business and improving the investment ecosystem and business activities.\par \par \uc2 The law was passed to achieve the goal of stimulating domestic and foreign investment to transform the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sphere, opening up opportunities for multinational companies. The government has offered enticements, including more-accessible methods for obtaining licenses for foreign workers and several \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  incentives, along with deductible \b \highlight22\uc2 taxes\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Asian Development\uc2  Outlook (ADO) 2022 revealed that investment is benefiting from expanding demand based on Indonesia's increasing consumer \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  and manufacturing.\par \par \uc2 However, the onslaught of political tensions rising in Europe and Asia has the potential to hinder foreign direct investment, while government regulations at regional levels remain as a distinct challenge because of the many procedures and requirements that are time-consuming and costly even under the new law.\par \par \uc2 The war in Ukraine in particular has wide-ranging ramifications throughout the global community. The Spring 2022 Deloitte European Chief Financial Officers Survey reported very high levels of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  among CFOs, higher than at any time since the inception of the survey in 2015.\par \par \uc2 On the consumer side, the geopolitical situation has caused a global cost-of-living crisis as sanctions and disruptions continue to batter trade and energy supplies. With prices for essential items rising, many have been forced to cut down on their \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,\par \par \uc2 In particular, issues such as high inflation, low growth as well as supply chain disruptions caused by the scarcity and rising cost of raw materials, commodities, energy and transport are among the most pressing concerns from the industry, which has just been reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Indonesia has posted another solid GDP reading, which was up 5.72 percent year-on-year (yoy) in the third quarter as reported by Statistics Indonesia (BPS). The figure exceeds the 5.44 percent yoy growth rate recorded in the second quarter and 5.01 percent yoy logged in the first.\par \par \uc2 Amid global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  concerns, Indonesia's national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is benefiting this year from relaxed pandemic restrictions at home as well as higher prices for key export commodities in global markets. With Indonesia's dream of joining the top-five economies with a per-capita income of $23,000 by 2045, a conducive investment climate is vital to the national workforce so as to reduce the rate of unemployment, strengthen \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and increase productivity.\par \par \uc2 With this in mind, The Jakarta Post collaborated with the Investment Ministry Coordinating Board (BKPM) which aims to highlight Indonesian perspectives toward the global financial state of affairs, especially in regards to Indonesia's investment climate and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2 -recovery efforts through the upcoming Jakpost Spotlight #13: Expanding investment amid geopolitical conflicts.\par \par \uc2 To be held on Nov. 21, the thirteenth edition of Jakpost Spotlight aims to discuss relevant topics with some of the most-influential figures and key decision makers in Indonesia in a talk-show format.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Minister for Investment Planning Indra Darmawan and \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  chief economist Andry Asmoro will be on-hand to exchange their views and opinions on Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  forecast, including the importance of investments for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  climate, the evolution of regulations in encouraging more investments, challenges in attracting domestic and foreign investors as well as Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook for 2023 in regards to the government's investment targets.\par \par \uc2 To register for the webinar for free, visit bit.ly/Spotlight-13, or scan the QR code.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221116eibg00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

The mountains and the earth reflect solidity and stability.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the mountain is a symbol of optimistic growth to help all ASEAN members advance better, she explained.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the ocean connects and unites all islands of countries in the region, she noted.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, the Maleo bird represents Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s rich biodiversity as the bird is endemic to Sulawesi, she said.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the logo emphasizes dynamism, responsiveness, and adaptivity in addressing all global and regional challenges.\par \par \uc2 ASEAN has three pillars of cooperation, namely the political security pillar, the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  pillar, and the sociocultural pillar.\par \par \uc2 During Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s chairmanship, discussions on issues related to the political security pillar will be led by Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law, and Security Mahfud MD as well as Marsudi.\par \par \uc2 Discussions on the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  pillar will be coordinated by Coordinating Minister for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  AffairsAirlangga Hartarto, and the sociocultural pillar by Coordinating Minister for Human Development and CultureMuhadjir Effendy.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the general coordination with the ASEAN Secretariat will be carried out by the Foreign Affairs Ministry.\par \par \uc2 The first activity of Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s ASEAN chairmanship will be a foreign affairs ministerial meeting in January 2023. Most technical-level meetings will be held at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta.\par \par \uc2 The new building at the secretariat currently has adequate meeting rooms, thus it would be suitable for holding ASEAN meetings.\par \par \uc2 So far, it has been estimated that more than 50 meetings will be held at the ASEAN Secretariat during Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s chairmanship next year.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia will also implement a number of flagship events during its chairmanship, including the Indo-Pacific Infrastructure Forum and the ASEAN Creative \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Business Forum.\par \par \uc2 With good intentions and hard work, Indonesia"s ASEAN chairmanship will hopefully benefit not only the Indonesian people, but also the people of ASEAN and the world\u8212\'20\'14because ASEAN matters as an epicenter of growth.\par \par \uc2 Multidimensional challenges\par \par \uc2 Indonesia"s ASEAN chairmanship, which will extend from January 1 to December 21, 2023, has come amid an \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  global situation, which has brought multidimensional challenges.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia"s chairmanship has come at a time when the global situation is not easy\u8212\'20\'14from geopolitics to \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the condition is still not conducive, Marsudi noted.\par \par \uc2 Further, the current geopolitical rivalries may remain sharp next year. ASEAN has expressed the hope that the rivalries will not trigger another conflict, especially in the Indo-Pacific and Southeast Asian regions.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, regarding the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , if countries do not immediately strengthen their cooperation to overcome the food and energy crises as well as tackle the scarcity of fertilizers, the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  capacity of developing countries, in particular, will weaken.\par \par \uc2 Then, the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will be even bleaker next year, the minister added.\par \par \uc2 She said that the ASEAN community should be grateful that in the midst of projections of a continued decline in the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , growth in the Southeast Asia region has been above the global average.\par \par \uc2 She recalled that Southeast Asia had been affected by a severe financial crisis earlier, however, the region had given a fairly strong \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance since then.\par \par \uc2 She said that ASEAN\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth has almost always been above the world average, for instance, the region\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in 2012 reached 6.2 percent, when global growth was recorded at 2.7 percent.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, in 2015 and 2018, the region\u8217\'20\'19s growth was 4.8 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, better than the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth of 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, ASEAN"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth were recorded at 4.6 percent and 2.6 percent in 2019, respectively.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the region\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is projected to reach 5.1 percent in 2022, higher than the global growth of 3.2 percent.\par \par \uc2 The estimation is based on the performance of each ASEAN country in 2022, which has been quite good so far, Marsudi stated.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Indonesia posted an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth of 5.72 percent in the third quarter of 2022, an increase from 5.4 percent in the second quarter of the year, she noted.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia wants to maintain this positive trend to make Southeast Asia the epicenter of growth and maintain regional stability.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-UYU/A/R013/R013) 17-11-2022 00:52:50\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221116eibh002be\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 BUSSINESS\par \b \uc2 RECOVERY IN TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FUELLING TOURISM REVIVAL: SUMADI\b0\par\par\uc2 609 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 November 2022\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Azis Kurmala\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Recovery efforts in the transportation sector have contributed to the revival of the tourism sector in the country, Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi has said.\par \par \uc2 "This effort is a turning point for the revival of the transportation industry because it continues to increase passenger occupancy," he observed at the Global Tourism Forum or the 2022 Global Tourism Forum-Annual Meeting in Bali on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 He said that a number of efforts have been made to revive transportation, including the issuance of several circulars regarding easier transportation and travel requirements, while still prioritizing the implementation of the health protocols.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the Ministry of Transportation, together with transportation operators, is also continuing to optimize the use of technology to minimize the spread of the virus, including by digitizing services at airports and using HEPA filters to keep the air at \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  transportation facilities clean.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, the Transportation Ministry has also launched a number of incentives, for example, Aircraft Passenger Services (PJP2U) or Passenger Service Charge (PSC) in the aviation sector.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the forum, the minister said that the recovery efforts have started to show results. One of the indicators is that, based on data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS), transportation and warehousing grew the most in the third quarter of 2022 at 25.8 percent (year on year).\par \par \uc2 This shows a trend that has continued to increase since early 2022 and has made an important contribution to Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, which increased by 5.72 percent year on year in the third quarter of 2022.\par \par \uc2 However, the Minister of Transportation reminded all parties to continue to strive to maintain the momentum of growth and remain alert to conditions created by global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , such as further pandemics, climate change, and global war tensions in the future.\par \par \uc2 He also revealed efforts to build the future of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  transportation in post-pandemic Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that we must think ahead. In the future, Indonesia needs to improve network connectivity, transportation safety, environmentally friendly transportation, and intermodal integration," he said.\par \par \uc2 For increasing connectivity between regions, the Ministry of Transportation will continue to build transportation infrastructure, both in urban areas and in remote, frontier, lagging, and border areas (3TP).\par \par \uc2 To overcome the limited state \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  capacity (APBN) for financing transportation infrastructure development in Indonesia, the Minister of Transportation will continue to encourage non-APBN creative funding through the \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Private Partnership (PPP) scheme, state asset funds, utilization cooperation (KSP), mixed financing, green financing in green project infrastructure, as well as establishing a \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Service Agency (BLU) and increasing non-\b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  state revenue (PNBP).\par \par \uc2 "At the moment of the G20 Presidency, we signed several memorandums of understanding for non-APBN creative funding with three countries, namely Japan, England, and South Korea, for the development of the Jakarta MRT (Mass Rapid Transit),\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The government is also committed to reducing exhaust emissions from fossil fuel vehicles by starting to transform energy from fossil fuels into new renewable energy (EBT), he added.\par \par \uc2 The government is targeting to produce at least two million electric vehicles by 2025.\par \par \uc2 It will develop an electric vehicle ecosystem so that Indonesia does not remain merely a market or consumer of electric vehicles but also becomes a producer given its natural resource potential for producing components for electric vehicles.\par \par \uc2 The Minister of Transportation also underlined the importance of strengthening cooperation with stakeholders such as ministries or other institutions, state-owned enterprises (BUMN), the private sector, academia, the media, and the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/R013/R013) 18-11-2022 05:11:00\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221117eibi002gx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Azis Kurmala\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Current account balance in the 2022 third quarter (Q3) recorded US$4.4-billion surplus, or 1.3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), surpassing previous quarter"s US$4 billion, or 1.2 percent of GDP, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 stated.\par \par \uc2 The improvement in current account performance stemmed from an increase in the surplus in non-oil and gas trade balance in line with the continued strong demand for exports from trading partner countries and high global commodity prices as well as reduced \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the oil and gas trade balance in line with the decline in world oil prices.\par \par \uc2 "The current account performance in the third quarter of 2022 is getting more solid by continuing the trend of increasing surpluses, supported by stronger performance in non-oil and gas exports," Executive Director of the BI Communication Department Erwin Haryono noted in an official statement here, Friday.\par \par \uc2 Thus, the current account balance can withstand pressure on Indonesia"s balance of payments (NPI) due to pressure on the capital and financial account, in line with increasing global financial market \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The balance of payments in the third quarter of this year recorded a \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of US$1.3 billion, with the position of foreign exchange reserve assets at September-end of 2022 recorded at US$130.8 billion, or equivalent to financing 5.7 months of imports and servicing government"s external debt, and was well above the international adequacy standard of three months of imports.\par \par \uc2 Capital and financial account pressures were reflected in a \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of US$6.1 billion, or 1.8 percent of the GDP, higher than the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of US$1.2 billion, or 0.3 percent of the GDP in the second quarter of this year. However, the performance of this transaction can still be supported by direct investment amid increasing \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in global financial markets.\par \par \uc2 Foreign direct investment recorded a surplus that remained high in line with investor optimism regarding the prospects for \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  improvement and a maintained domestic investment climate. Meanwhile, net portfolio investment outflows increased due to heightened \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in global financial markets and the need to repay maturing private debt securities.\par \par \uc2 Other investment transactions also recorded a rise in \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  due to an increase in private assets, especially those related to operational business activities.\par \par \uc2 Going forward, BI will continually focus on the dynamics of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that can affect the prospects for the balance of payments and keep strengthening its \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix supported by close \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  coordination with the government and relevant authorities to strengthen external sector resilience.\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 18-11-2022 19:35:56\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221118eibi001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 As tech giants face axing spree, small start-ups regain funding momentum\b0\par\par\uc2 Deni Ghifari, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 913 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The layoff wave that has been sweeping through the Indonesian-tech landscape within the past two months is nothing surprising, experts say, as the situation is bound to happen across the globe, insinuating a similar trend recently happened among tech giants in Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 The so-called "tech winter" phenomenon recently involved several Indonesian household names such as Shopee, Xendit and TokoCrypto.\par \par \uc2 However, the most scrutiny arguably went to GoTo, one of Indonesian biggest tech firms that went \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  earlier this year who announced on Friday that it is cutting 1,300 people or 12 percent of its total workforce.\par \par \uc2 "This hard decision is inevitable for the company is looking become more agile and maintain the growth rate so it can keep giving positive impact for consumers, driver partners and sellers," reads GoTo's press statement.\par \par \uc2 The release said that this decision was partly caused by the global macroeconomic situation, albeit long-term sustainable business model was what it looked to forge.\par \par \uc2 "[GoTo] will keep on pushing a healthy business growth while, at the same time, practicing operational efficiency, so we can keep giving the best solution for the people," GoTo chief of corporate affairs Nila Marita told The Jakarta Poston Monday.\par \par \uc2 Yorlin Ng, chief operating officer of Momentum Works, a Singaporean venture outfit said that tech companies have had a good decade with an almost-zero interest rate which led the environment to be growth-focused without prioritizing efficiency.\par \par \uc2 For that reason, such layoffs were due sooner or later, said Ng, but also noted that "how they would take place and to what extent they would happen could not be predicted".\par \par \uc2 "Big-tech companies have had a good decade, but no one should take good times with almost zero interest rate for granted," said Ng on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Adding fuel to the fire, macro-\b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  place this business model even closer to the edge by making it increasingly difficult to secure external funding while, simultaneously, tech companies have to deal with drops in revenue, making them cautious on cost.\par \par \uc2 "In tough times like we are in now, efficiency and sustainability imperatives will override growth considerations, hence the current trend of layoffs to control costs," Ng explained.\par \par \uc2 For her part, Ng said what's important is how the market adapts to the macro environment so the companies can maintain their competitiveness once the storm has passed and, on the flip-side, non-tech companies and startups thinking about innovating can take advantage of these layoffs given how they are able to recruit talents.\par \par \uc2 However, she underlined, the silver lining was that tech workers would become more conscious about the rapidly changing world and for that, they would build not only skills, but also competencies and insights to keep themselves relevant.\par \par \uc2 "Those who want to join the tech sector should really be forward-looking and join sectors or functions that have significant growth potential in the next 5-10 years," said Ng.\par \par \uc2 In the long term, she added, the market will revert back to the equilibrium of supply-and-demand in talent and labor, as it always does.\par \par \uc2 Concurring with Ng, Roshan Raj Behera, the Southeast Asian partner of Indian management-consulting company Redseer, said that the current layoff trend is not entirely surprising.\par \par \uc2 "Larger players [are] taking some time to assess the situation and avoiding a knee-jerk reaction in terms of retrenchments. Unlike their smaller peers, the larger companies tend to take a more-informed decision given their higher relevance in the ecosystem," Behera toldthe Poston Monday.\par \par \uc2 Behera said that both the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and private sector are concerned about the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook, but once there is better visibility, he said, they would see more constructive trends in the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and private markets.\par \par \uc2 Behera explained that the relatively low \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  since the Great Recession could be treated as anomaly trends given how the \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  were relatively higher in the preceding years and, accordingly, it is unlikely for the high-growth and high-cash-burn phase to reestablish its presence.\par \par \uc2 "We are likely to witness a balanced-growth trajectory going forward," Behera said, emphasizing that this trend might result in a healthier climate.\par \par \uc2 No slowdown for funding\par \par \uc2 Despite the overall tech downturn, early-stage startups are still continuing their upward trajectory and Behera saw no reason for a slowdown in funding as companies that fill a need-gap and are able to clearly provide a growth path to a profitable trajectory will continue to get funded.\par \par \uc2 However, the same prospect cannot be said for medium-to-larger companies as they are already seeing a tapering of 25-percent investment value this year, plunging to a seven-quarter low in the July-September time window.\par \par \uc2 "[Big tech companies'] first priority will be to get their unit economics and cash runway sorted," said Behera, adding that "once that is done, they will be back in the capital-raising mode and, in the meantime, big-tech companies can consider alternatives in the form of bridge loans or convertibles."\par \par \uc2 The firing spree did not only take place in Indonesia; it also happened in the Mecca of tech, Silicon Valley, spelling out that not one company in the tech industry is immune to the drift.\par \par \uc2 Over the past week, 20,000 employees from \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , \uc2 Meta\uc2 , \uc2 Stripe\uc2 , \uc2 Lyft\uc2  and a growing list of smaller companies have been laid off.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221118eibi00034\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 BI implements third 50 bps rate hike to aid rupiah\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 781 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 has decided to raise its benchmark rate by another 50 basis points (bps) in a move to bring down domestic inflation and to safeguard the rupiah from depreciating even further against the United States dollar.\par \par \uc2 The rate hike marks the fourth consecutive month of BI's tighter monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  as the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  brings the benchmark rate to 5.25 percent. Deposit and lending facility rates, meanwhile, also saw another 50 bps rise to 4.5 and 6 percent, respectively.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 's decision was well above expectations from many analysts and economists. Financial research firm \uc2 Moody's\uc2  Analytics, for instance, forecast only a 25 bps hike.\par \par \uc2 "The decision to increase \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  is a front-loaded, pre-emptive and forward-looking measure to reduce overshooting inflation expectations and ensure future core inflation returns to the target range of 3 plus/minus 1 percent in the first half of 2023," BI Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  told reporters on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, BI expects inflation to continue rising and remain high until the end of this year, albeit lower than the projected consensus. By comparison, BI's forecast on inflation is less than 5.6 percent, whereas the consensus projects 5.9 percent.\par \par \uc2 The bank also expects core inflation to keep increasing until the end of this year, reaching 3.5 percent. The increase is expected to continue until the first two months of the first quarter of next year. Nonetheless, thanks to recent measures, BI stated, the hike might be well below what many have expected.\par \par \uc2 Perry also reiterated that the rate hike was deemed necessary to bring the rupiah's exchange rate to its "fundamental value" amid the ever-strengthening US dollar driven by heightened \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the global financial market.\par \par \uc2 The rupiah had depreciated by more than 8.6 percent year to date (ytd) as of Nov. 16, to Rp 15,610 per US dollar, much deeper than last month's depreciation of 8.03 percent ytd.\par \par \uc2 BI noted that central banks in many countries would be likely to retain their tight monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as they expect the \uc2 US Federal Reserve\uc2  to announce more rate hikes until early 2023, putting further pressure on exchange rates and capital flows in many countries, including Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Fikri C. Permana, senior economist at Samuel Securities toldThe Jakarta Poston Thursday that BI's recent decision could increase the cost of short-term loans and yields on corporate bonds. He said it could also lead to slower credit disbursement growth starting in 2023, as previous hikes start to take effect.\par \par \uc2 "We can expect \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth to be less expansive starting in the last quarter this year," Fikri said.\par \par \uc2 However, he said the decision was perceived positively by investors in capital markets, which are more concerned over the prolonged rupiah depreciation, as it could be followed by more costly imported goods, which could lead to imported inflation.\par \par \uc2 BI is expected to keep raising its benchmark rate by another 25 or 50 bps depending on global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions, he said, adding that until the end of this year, BI would still need to catch up with another Fed 50 bps hike.\par \par \uc2 Faisal Rachman, economist at \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  expected BI to continue raising its benchmark rate by another 25 bps until the end of this year and another 25 bps next year to peak at 5.75 percent in the first half 2023.\par \par \uc2 He explained that although US inflation had eased in October, the Fed kept stressing the need to remain carefully hawkish, causing \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the global financial market, which could also lead to continuing capital outflows.\par \par \uc2 Domestically, he expected inflation to keep running at around 5 to 6 percent at least until the first half of next year due to the second-round impact of higher fuel prices.\par \par \uc2 "BI will likely continue hiking the BI-7DRRR to ensure stability. All in all, as a front-loaded, pre-emptive, and forward-looking measure," Faisal said in a statement, referring to the bank's main interest rate.\par \par \uc2 Febrio Kacaribu, head of the \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency at the Finance Ministry told reporters on Thursday that he viewed the BI decision as a conducive sign for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "BI is performing its function to maintain the rupiah exchange rate. It will be conducive to macroeconomic certainty," Febrio said.\par \par \uc2 He added that the government would continue coordinating with the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  to formulate the best \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  outcome for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . This includes keeping inflation low, as it is also one of many factors that affect BI's rate decisions.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221118eibi0003a\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 We Are Expediting Early Retirement of Coal Power Plants\b0\par\par\uc2 2,458 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 AS the sole electricity provider, state electricity company PLN stands front and center in the endeavors to reduce emission through energy transition. Some of the initiatives being taken include the use of biomass and coal mixture in coal-fired power stations (PLTUs) and retiring several PLTUs earlier.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, given a large chunk of greenhouse gas emissions the transportation sector generates, \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  has the responsibility to develop build an ecosystem for electric vehicles (EVs). As a country with the largest nickel reserve in the world, Indonesia possesses huge potential to produce EV batteries locally.\par \par \uc2 Decommissioning PLTUs early or the development of an EV ecosystem require massive funds. Of the Rp4,000 trillion cost to reduce 31.89 percent emissions by 2030, the energy sector will absorb the largest portion although it contributes less emission than the forestry and land sectors. \u8220\'20\'1CEnergy transition initiatives must get the financing promised by the western countries,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Pahala Mansury\uc2 , the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Deputy Minister.\par \par \uc2 In an approximately one and half hour-long chat with Tempo at his residence on November 9, former \uc2 Garuda Indonesia\uc2  chief executive officer (CEO) explained the energy transition strategies, the development of EV ecosystem and SOEs\u8217\'20\'19 role in greenhouse gas emission reduction.\par \par \uc2 What exactly are the energy sector\u8217\'20\'19s emission reduction initiatives?\par \par \uc2 The planned early retirement of PLTUs denotes Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s spirit to achieve the net zero emission. In line with the nationally determined contribution (NDC), Indonesia targets to reduce emissions by almost 32 percent in 2030. One of the initiatives is to accelerate the retirement of coal power plants operation.\par \par \uc2 How?\par \par \uc2 First, by developing new and renewable energies. Second, by accelerating the closure of PLTUs. One of the challenges is that we have a massive power supply. In the next several years, we will have 12 gigawatts (GW) of particularly coal-based electricity. If we don\u8217\'20\'19t expedite the PLTU retirement, with the entry of renewable energy, we will have excess power supply.\par \par \uc2 What is the funding like?\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19ve established cooperation with several parties, including \uc2 Asian Development Bank\uc2 , through the ETM (energy transition mechanism) funding. It is a blended finance concept (joint funding from \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and private investors), a cheaper financing to be provided by several countries, and also financing from new investors that will include some type of philanthropic funds. So, we will have grants and a blended finance so that we can decommission PLTUs earlier. For instance, if the operational life is 24 years, we can shorten it to 15 years. So, there\u8217\'20\'19s 10 years of reduced emissions.\par \par \uc2 State-Owned Enterprises Deputy Minister Pahala Nugraha Mansury during an interview with Tempo in Jakarta, November 9. Tempo/Tony Hartawan\par \par \uc2 We are using two plants as pilot projects, PLTUs in Palabuhanratu, West Java, and in Pacitan, East Java. If we can successfully retire them early, we can reduce seven to nine million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) in one year. It means 90 million tons of reduced CO2 in 10 years. This will also help improve PLN\u8217\'20\'19s balance sheet. If PLN can spin off these coal power plants and no longer consolidate their finances in (PLN\u8217\'20\'19s) balance sheet, its loans and liabilities can be reduced. Most potential (buyers) are players who currently have coal. They will definitely want to (invest) because it\u8217\'20\'19s part of downstreaming. They produce not only coal but also electricity. I refer to Bukit Asam or any other players who are going to invest here.\par \par \uc2 In our opinion, the projects should be counted commercially. Bukit Asam is a \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  company. If they eventually become the new owner, it must be calculated financially. They have to be in commercially. Based on the above-mentioned concept, the program must receive blended finance under the ETM financing the international parties, including ADB, have pledged.\par \par \uc2 PLN has reportedly offered (PLTUs) but there has been no interest. Will this scheme save PLN\u8217\'20\'19s finances but sacrifice other SOEs?\par \par \uc2 First, they must include power purchase agreement in their calculation to receive appropriate internal rate of return. Second, the statement that there\u8217\'20\'19s no interest is not true. We offered to several countries and some were very interested. The hurdle is not in finding investors nor in their equity, but in this ETM financing.\par \par \uc2 Is it because the calculation has not been completed?\par \par \uc2 No. Right now, the funding must be categorized as green financing. These institutions said, \u8216\'20\'18if I finance it now, it means I am financing additional hydrocarbon whereas in reality the aim according to the concept is to reduce emission.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Which countries have acknowledged ETM as part of the green taxonomy?\par \par \uc2 Precisely, there aren\u8217\'20\'19t many. We have to inform them that the green financing or this ETM should be part of the green finance taxonomy. Therefore, in addition to the agreement between Bukit Asam and PLN, we also signed a cooperation agreement between PLN and Sarana Multi Infrastructure (SMI) with the hope that the country platform the SMI is currently building will help enhance our efforts to get the ETM categorized as green finance taxonomy.\par \par \uc2 What other schemes are there other than the early retirement of PLTUs?\par \par \uc2 There are three: acquisition, independent power producer (IPP), and continued payment without generating electricity. It\u8217\'20\'19s better they stay operational and retire early. PLN will not suffer losses but receive income instead. The balance sheet gets better and the acquiring company happy.\par \par \uc2 But Bukit Asam doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have a plan to go in yet, does it?\par \par \uc2 But they\u8217\'20\'19re beginning to invest in the PLTU. In our opinion, this in fact is good for Bukit Asam to ensure its sustainability. When, for instance, other countries no longer buy their coal, this is actually a great option for them to shift towards coal gasification\u8212\'20\'14downstreaming coal for production of methanol for the petrochemical industry, and also electricity.\par \par \uc2 How much loan interest percentage Bukit Asam must pay to acquire the PLTU in Palabuhanratu?\par \par \uc2 Around 3 to 5 percent. That\u8217\'20\'19s our expectation. Commercial \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  hover around 7 to 8 percent.\par \par \uc2 Is there any commitment from the Western countries?\par \par \uc2 They are interested. They haven\u8217\'20\'19t made commitment in black and white but they are interested if, for instance, blended finance is available, and even more so if it can be categorized as green taxonomy.\par \par \uc2 What other efforts have been made to promote emission reduction?\par \par \uc2 Electric motorcycles in addition to stoves. We also hope for (electric) cars but we need compensation. It\u8217\'20\'19s easier to sell motorcycles. The current price of a motorcycle without battery is already Rp18 million.\par \par \uc2 Will SOEs take part in this electric motorcycle procurement?\par \par \uc2 We hope so. We hope at least Rp18 million is a reasonable price in terms of value. For the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 , they can save up to Rp1.2 million a year in fuel cost from one unit (electric) motorcycle, assuming they use six litters per week or one litter per day.\par \par \uc2 But leasing is still very low.\par \par \uc2 We have to push. Their biggest concern is the residual value because the liquidity value of an electric motorcycle is not known yet. How much would they get if they sell back? But there\u8217\'20\'19s no liquidity if there\u8217\'20\'19s no motorcycle (asset). We hope that battery swap will reduce \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  because actually it is the value of the battery that diminishes. The motorcycle itself remains more or less the same. In fact, it will even become more durable because it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t need oil and so on.\par \par \uc2 SOEs haven\u8217\'20\'19t been assessed in the automotive industry.\par \par \uc2 SOEs in this matter provide the infrastructure for battery swap. But what is to do if there\u8217\'20\'19s no motorcycle. That\u8217\'20\'19s why initially we wanted to sell motorcycle including the battery. Actually, we want to rent the battery. But for the start, we are pushing the sale of motorcycle including the battery so the market can grow.\par \par \uc2 The EV ecosystem needs lithium. How will you fill that gap?\par \par \uc2 Well, import. But 60 percent is nickel.\par \par \uc2 But there\u8217\'20\'19s a lithium component.\par \par \uc2 Correct. But still 65 percent of the battery cost is in nickel. And the added value is in processing the precursors into cathode. So, we may have to collaborate with other countries.\par \par \uc2 Is there a plan to cooperate with a lithium factory?\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s our hope. Currently we are discussing with two consortiums. Within the consortiums are those that already have cobalt and lithium. Now, we are hoping they would supply them to us. So, indeed partnership is the key but we want as much as possible, as maximal as possible, so that it (battery) can be manufactured here.\par \par \uc2 Does the government have any plan to add stakes in \uc2 Vale\uc2 , a nickel mining company?\par \par \uc2 Not yet.\par \par \uc2 We have the option to increase (shares) up to 51 percent, right?\par \par \uc2 The option we have now for sure is 11 percent additional shares. Whether it can be more than 11 percent, we don\u8217\'20\'19t know yet. But 11 percent was what we agreed on when the contract was extended in 2014.\par \par \uc2 As regards renewable energy, PLN has been stymieing the rooftop solar power plant (PLTS) project.\par \par \uc2 It indeed is dilemmatic. We have excess electricity, right? Not to mention the 7 GW that will be added this year. So, PLN has the obligation to pay for the electricity procured from IPPs. If, for instance, PLTSs are built, it means the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s electricity consumption will drop while what is needed precisely right now is to boost consumption. We hope that a series of available policies to jack-up demand, be it the planned electric stove or motorcycle schemes, will help lessen the excess. We also hope that once it\u8217\'20\'19s running, the electric motorcycle program will absorb much of the excess electricity.\par \par \uc2 Pahala Nugraha Mansury\par \par \uc2 Place and Date of Birth: Bogor, West Java, April 8, 1971\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 * Master of Business Administration from \uc2 Leonard N.

What is its role?\par \par \uc2 Hydrogen. As far as I know, the other day we signed an agreement, for example, to produce hydrogen. Actually, there was a lot of discussion including about battery production and battery swap (through) cooperation with Indonesia Battery Corporation using \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  gas stations (SPBU).\par \par \uc2 What will their contribution through SPBU look like?\par \par \uc2 It can be for charging battery or battery swap. Beyond battery, I guess \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  must focus on three things. First, the biorefinery project with Perkebunan Nusantara for bioethanol production. Second, hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) for production of, for example, if possible, biodiesel B40 or even B50 from the current 30 percent (B30). Third, HVO-based Avtur, a sustainable aviation fuel.\par \par \uc2 What about the cooperation between \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  and Russia?\par \par \uc2 The current agreement is for the construction of a new grass root refinery in Tuban (East Java) with the capacity of 300,000 barrels per day. Indonesia is still importing 300,000 barrels fuel. With this, we can reduce fuel imports.\par \par \uc2 Is there any plan to buy Russian oil being sold at discounted prices?\par \par \uc2 Not yet.\par \par \uc2 Why not?\par \par \uc2 The problem is to make sure that there is no negative impact on \uc2 Pertamina\uc2  since \uc2 Pertamina\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s funding sources include global bonds and there are certain clauses (that make the purchase difficult).\par \par \uc2 Perkebunan Nusantara (PTPN) \uc2 has spun off Sugar.co. It seems the SOE is trying hard to find partners?\par \par \uc2 Our spirit is to find partners. We cannot mention who at this point. But we looked and found a new experienced partner for additional capital. We carried out the process transparently. Out of 15 companies we invited, seven remained first, then two and finally one. Everything was done openly. We don\u8217\'20\'19t see anything wrong with that. After all, they brought in the money. A new capital. And they have the experience. According to the plan, the fund will peak at Rp20 trillion.\par \par \uc2 Privatization of subsidiaries don\u8217\'20\'19t need to be approved by the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR)?\par \par \uc2 We informed the process (to the DPR) but this is categorically at the lower level, not at SOE. Indonesia now imports 4.1 million tons of sugar every year although we used to be the world\u8217\'20\'19s sugar barn. We used to produce 200 tons per hectare with yield above 12 percent. Now the average is 75 tons per hectare with 7 percent yield. What is lacking isn\u8217\'20\'19t sugar factory but sugarcane production. A lot of sugar factories are active for only 105 to 110 days and remain idle for the rest of the year. The ideal active period is 150 to 160 days per year per milling season.\par \par \uc2 State-Owned Enterprises Deputy Minister Pahala Nugraha Mansury (left) converses with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation India Country Office Director M Hari Menon (right), witnessed by Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science Sr. Division Chair-Education Nell Robinson in Bali, October 17. ANTARA FOTO/Nyoman Hendra Wibowo\par \par \uc2 Is it due to the lack of land?\par \par \uc2 There have been a lot of land use changes particularly in Central and East Java including my family\u8217\'20\'19s hometown of Asembagus, Situbondo, East Java. In Java, 60 to 70 percent of land has been converted for other uses. People who plant sugarcane nowadays receive Rp4 million per hectare per year. The rest is Rp4.1 million. Plus Rp10 to Rp11 million for land rental. Their annual income is Rp16 million.\par \par \uc2 The sugar company in Lampung is still well and active.\par \par \uc2 It can produce up to 90 tons with the potential to produce 100 tons. It\u8217\'20\'19s just that it is not managed well. We invited Brazilians. Brazil was a sugar importer back in 1978 but now they produce 6 million tons a year, excluding ethanol.\par \par \uc2 Is their success the result from the \uc2 Amazon\uc2  forest conversion?\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t know. If we just convert the ones that haven\u8217\'20\'19t been properly managed, we can still use 400 to 500 hectares.

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 INDONESIA\u8217\'20\'19s balance of payments is recording a stark contradiction. The Q3 2022 data released last week paints a picture of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  with two separate paths. They move in opposite directions, completely decoupled. In the real sector, there is a strong optimism. Meanwhile, in the financial market, negative sentiment is reigning.\par \par \uc2 The balance of payments is a comprehensive record of the movement of all the money going into and out of the country. There, we see a very large amount coming in through the trade of goods and services. Even though Indonesia still shoulders deficits in the service sector, there is an even bigger surplus from exports-imports because of high commodity prices. As a result, from the balance of trades and services\u8212\'20\'14what economists call the current account balance\u8212\'20\'14Indonesia still enjoys a surplus of US$4.38 billion throughout the period of July-September.\par \par \uc2 The amount of money flowing in through direct investment channels is also massive. In the same period, there has been a US$2.78 billion of capital incoming. This truly describes concrete optimism in Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s real \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sector. This data is a record of money that has already come in.\par \par \uc2 Thus, investors from all corners of the globe are indeed interested in the prospects of Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s post-pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery. They bring capital here, and the capitals are flowing into various new projects and business developments. In conclusion, Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s real \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sector is on an upward trajectory. Billions of dollars of capital are flowing in through export-import trading and direct investment. There is a mighty positive sentiment.\par \par \uc2 That picture is a complete contradiction of what is happening in the financial market. Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s balance of payments records massive amounts of money flowing out. Capital is fleeing from the financial market, especially the government bond market. Throughout Q3 2022, US$3.1 billion exited the market. Not only that, our balance of payments also recorded a huge outflow of capital placements in various foreign assets. Throughout Q3 2022, this amount reached US$4.67 billion.\par \par \uc2 It seems that the capital owners who are hunting for profit through financial assets have different views about investing in Indonesia than those investors in the real sector who are so optimistic about doing business in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 In the financial market, no such optimism exists. The \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions that engulfed the global financial markets certainly had a hand in driving out that capital. Tightening dollar liquidity around the world has sucked investment reallocation out from developing countries. Other than going after more attractive yields, it is also a flight for safety. Ultimately, the capital outflow in the financial sector amounts to more than the total surplus from the trade of goods and services and direct investment. As a result, throughout Q3 2022, Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s balance of payments had a \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of US$1.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 This is the real challenge for Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Massive capital outflow might not slow down in the near future. As long as global market conditions are still volatile and liquidity is tightening, money will seek safe havens. On the other hand, as the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is starting to slow down, our trade surplus is likely to shrink. Thus, Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s balance of payments most likely will stay in the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 The real impact of the balance of payments \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  is the weakening of the rupiah exchange rate. Consequently, continuing flights of capital and the weakening of the rupiah will force \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 keeps raising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In the last four months, BI has raised its rates from 3.5 percent to 5.25 percent, with the latest hike being 0.5 percent last week. Interest keeps rising, yet capital flight is \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  to stop. This can end up as an endless cycle, a vicious spiraling down effect to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/20/816362/816362_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020221121eibk0000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Is Indonesian  \highlight22\uc2 economy \highlight\uc2  facing headwinds?\b0\par\par\uc2 940 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Winarno Zain, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Bali has every reason to celebrate, not only because it was at the center of the world attention when it successfully hosted the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  Summit early last week, but also because its \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , notably its tourism industry, received a big boost from the series of international conferences.\par \par \uc2 But the joy of the Balinese is overshadowed by \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  headwinds that have been slowly blowing to other provinces. Reports have emerged of the increasing worker layoffs in some parts of Java. Labor-intensive manufacturing--textile, footwear, electronics--have been shedding hundreds of thousands of workers, as orders from overseas are shrinking. And more layoffs may be imminent.\par \par \uc2 It seems that the country is not immune to the bleak global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , still reeling from the pandemic, which is now battered by high inflation, rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  and energy and food insecurity caused by the war in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 But amid these gloomy world prospects, the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  still showed strong recovery in the nine months to October, with 5.4-percent growth year-on-year (yoy), after growing 3.7 percent\par \par \uc2 in 2021. Government consumption shrank by 4.7 percent and remained a drag on growth, as it is winding down the pandemic-related \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2 . But private consumption, export and gross fixed-capital investment more than offset the slack in government \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Gross fixed-capital formation rose 5 percent in 2022 compared with 3.8 percent in 2021. These are in line with the figures published by the \uc2 Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM)\uc2 . Realized domestic and foreign investment in the first half rose by 32 percent to Rp 585 trillion (US$39 billion). But most of the investments were put into mining and mineral-processing industries.\par \par \uc2 In response to the commodity boom, investment in the mining sector almost tripled from Rp 6.5 trillion in the first quarter to Rp 18.4 trillion in the second quarter. This trend raised questions about the quality of investment, as most of the investments were channeled to the commodity sector, which usually has short-term business cycles.\par \par \uc2 As most of the investments were aimed to tap windfall from the commodity sector with its short business cycles, they would not be sustainable in the long term, especially taking into account Indonesia's commitment to the higher climate-action target. Pouring investments into the exploitation of natural resources also would adversely affect the flow of investments to a more productive and more technologically driven manufacturing base.\par \par \uc2 Whether such strong growth could be sustained in the next quarters is \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2 . What is clear, however, is that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the growth in the third quarter was only 1.8 percent, a steep fall from 3.8-percent growth in the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 That the growth is losing steam is also apparent in the country's trade. Total exports were up 33 percent in October yoy, and imports were up 28 percent. But exports and imports have declined by 10 percent since August.\par \par \uc2 Imports of raw materials and capital goods, which are directly related to output growth, were down by 15 percent and 14 percent respectively between August and October.\par \par \uc2 The global financial condition will be getting tighter as the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2  will continue its hawkish policies to tame inflation. \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 last week also raised its benchmark rate--for the fourth consecutive time this year--by 50 basis points to 5.25 percent.\par \par \uc2 The dilemma for BI is that the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 -rate rise should not be too high as to hurt the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but also should not be too little to have an impact on curbing inflation.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  position is currently solid, with a surplus at 0.3 percent GDP in September, as revenues were up by 46 percent and \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2  rose by 6 percent yoy.\par \par \uc2 Although government foreign debts have declined, total debts outstanding rose from Rp 7.1 quadrillion in the second quarter to Rp 7.4 quadrillion in the third quarter. Accordingly, the interest cost of the government debts rose to Rp 279 trillion. The government-debt interests will continue to increase along with the rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  globally.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian banking system is in good shape after a series of restructurings during the pandemic. Bank loans grew strongly by 10.3 percent in June. Nonperforming loans (NPL) declined to 2.86 percent from 3.0 percent in June 2021. Their capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 24.7 percent, well above the Basel (BIS)-mandated regulatory minimum of 8 percent.\par \par \uc2 While strong bank capital is a buffer and the first line of defense against \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  shocks, rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  would bring headwinds for the banking sector as a higher interest rate tends to compress net interest margin (NIM) in the short to medium term.\par \par \uc2 There is also concern over the continuing decline in foreign-exchange \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  that have dropped by $6 billion to $130 billion in the September quarter. This indicated that the increasing interest rate in the US has triggered capital outflows and has forced BI to intervene in the market in order to stem rupiah depreciation. It would be difficult for BI to maintain foreign exchange \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which are quite important in the face of looming recession and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The government should continue its prudent macroeconomic policies since they are the best defense in the face of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil. Just like a ship that needs robust hull and engine power to weather the storm, so does the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It needs strong fundamentals to ride out the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  headwinds.\par \par \uc2 __________________\par \par \uc2 An economist and a commissioner at a publicly listed company\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221120eibk0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Labor Unions to Sue Employers Insisting on Using PP 36 of 2021 to Determine Wage\b0\par\par\uc2 565 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo.co\par \uc2 TEMPOE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The President of the Indonesian Labor Unions Confederation (KSPI) Said Iqbal, said that he would sue employers who insist on using Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  (PP) 36 of 2021 concerning Wages to determine the minimum wage for workers.\par \par \uc2 "We will press charges. I will take it to court because that is embezzlement of employee salary", Said Iqbal said in a virtual press conference on Sunday, November 20, 2022.\par \par \uc2 The government through the Manpower Ministry has issued a new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , namely the Minister of Manpower \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  (Permenaker) No. 18 of 2022 concerning the stipulation of the minimum wage for 2023. In this \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the minimum wage is set to increase by a maximum of 10 percent.\par \par \uc2 Consequently, if employers continue to use the formula in Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36 of 2021, workers' salaries will be less than in the new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, Said is confident that the Minister of Manpower Ida Fauziyah, and the Director General for Development of Industrial Relations and Social Security for Workers, Indah Anggoro Putri, will act decisively and render punishment employers continue to use Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36 of 2021 as a reference to determine the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 "I am very sure both of them are supple but assertive, so they will be firmly dealt with," Said Iqbal said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Indonesian Employers' Association (Apindo) stated that they would file a lawsuit regarding the new minimum wage \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Apindo's Head of Manpower, Antonius Joenoes Supit, questioned the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  regarding the increase of UMP. "If a ministerial \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is not in line with the law or PP, is it right or wrong? That's all," he said when contacted on Sunday, November 20, 2022.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, Antonius said his association would still hold internal discussions to discuss the next steps for the ministerial \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "We will discuss this internally. I just happen to be out of town," he said.\par \par \uc2 The government decided to increase the provincial minimum wage (UMP) and district and city minimum wages (UMK) for people's purchasing power. "Purchasing power is represented by the inflation rate and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth variable which is created from productivity and indicators of expanding employment opportunities," said Ida Fauziyah in a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video from the Manpower Ministry Channel uploaded on Saturday, November 19, 2022.\par \par \uc2 According to Ida, currently, the socio-\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions of society have not fully recovered due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Purchasing power has also decreased in line with global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  which has implications for suppressing the pace of national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery. Even though the structure of the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is largely contributed by \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  consumption. So the recovery is heavily influenced by purchasing power and price fluctuations.\par \par \uc2 Because of this, the government no longer uses Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  (PP) 36 of 2021 concerning Wages as a reference because it is considered unable to accommodate the impact of the socio-\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions of the community. In this \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the determination of the minimum wage is not balanced with the rate of increase in the prices of goods.\par \par \uc2 "There is concern that it will result in a decline in workers' purchasing power to occur again in 2023," said Ida.\par \par \uc2 RIANI SANUSI PUTRI l IMAJI LASAHIDO\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo in Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/10/12/id_1148236/1148236_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020221121eibl000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: Securing growth momentum in 2023\b0\par\par\uc2 979 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Faisal Rachman, Mandiri, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 Indonesia has become one of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  countries--the world's 20 largest economies--that is resilient against this year's multiple \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  downturn cycles. It has managed to overcome the impact of the Omicron variant, Russia's invasion of Ukraine that triggered a global food security problem and energy crisis, and persistent high global inflation leading to interest rate hikes and financial turmoil (flight-to-quality).\par \par \uc2 In fact, Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance is regarded among the best in G20 economies and other countries.\par \par \uc2 Through \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turbulence, Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  evinces solid momentum as the GDP expanded by 5.40 percent year-on-year (yoy) in the first nine months of 2022, with an increasing pace in every quarter.\par \par \uc2 This achievement needs to be greatly appreciated since the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  could still be able to grow at a faster rate against the background of the escalating fear of a global recession.\par \par \uc2 During this period, an increasing number of countries were reported to decelerate, such as the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , the United Kingdom, the United States, and China to name a few.\par \par \uc2 How could Indonesia be resilient despite facing uneasy global challenges? Both domestic and external factors play a big role in Indonesia's impressive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 In short, vigorous COVID-19 management, including a high vaccination rate, has paved the way for the easing of mobility restrictions and thus a stronger domestic demand, which contributes to more than half of the gross domestic product.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, high global commodity prices have encouraged export, which consequently ensures a long series of trade surplus and external sector resilience and provided a windfall to state revenues, enabling the government to restrain the inflationary pressure impact from fuel and energy price adjustment (\b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  as a shock absorber).\par \par \uc2 Inflation was recorded at a relatively manageable rate of 5.71 percent yoy in October 2022, notably lower compared to other large economies of which some of them suffered from a double-digit inflation rate.\par \par \uc2 This allows the monetary authority, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI)\uc2 , not to aggressively raise the benchmark rate in favor of stability, which could discourage business and investment activities.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, controlled inflation fosters improving \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  purchasing power during the recovery period post COVID-19 pandemic, which will support growth at the end of the day.\par \par \uc2 So, with those solid fundamentals, how will Indonesia perform in the last quarter of the year and particularly in 2023? Will it remain resilient against shocks and outperform several rich world peers?\par \par \uc2 In spite of numerous \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  indicators suggesting positive trends which fuel optimism, the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  surrounding the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook remains exceptionally high.\par \par \uc2 The year 2022 is indeed a tough year for every country, but next year could be much tougher. Indonesia, thereby, must stay vigilant and be alert in heading toward the possibility of a perfect storm.\par \par \uc2 The main engines of growth in 2022, namely private consumption and export, will face various hurdles next year.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is at risk of weakening in the last quarter of this year as the inflation rate is prone to accelerate, a development which could undercut private consumption.\par \par \uc2 Inflation rate is also expected to be persistent between 5 to 6 percent yoy until the first half of 2023, giving a challenge for Indonesia to secure a higher growth rate.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, the bonus effect from the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  reopening starts to fade away. Hence, the government and BI need to ensure the availability and adequacy of food supplies and to anchor inflation expectations to meet the inflation target range.\par \par \uc2 Success in doing this will provide room for BI to stay away from implementing a too tight monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, expectations of a decreasing global growth indicating a slowdown in global trade could weigh on export performance. Shrinking trade surplus might return the current account balance from surplus this year to \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  next year.\par \par \uc2 Given remaining high \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the global financial market, the government will need to double down on efforts to attract more capital inflow, especially in foreign direct investment, in order to maintain the rupiah exchange rate stability (lowering the risk of imported inflation).\par \par \uc2 "In every challenge lives a greater opportunity."\par \par \uc2 Hard commodities-based extraction and manufacturing industries could still be the key driver of growth in 2023 amid a maintained external demand for commodities. China, the major trading partner, is expected to further ease its zero-COVID \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  which might boost its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth next year, meaning a better export demand to China.\par \par \uc2 This in consequence opens a prospect of increasing foreign direct investment into downstream heavy industries, generating more added values for export-oriented commodities.\par \par \uc2 In addition, this attempt could partially offset the adverse effect of monetary tightening on investment into other industries.\par \par \uc2 The shift from pandemic to endemic also gives space for the government to resume national strategic projects, which was hampered during the pandemic by the fund reallocation for the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery program. This could increase building and structure (infrastructure) investments, which tend to be sluggish this year.\par \par \uc2 Other strategies that might spur the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  are green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  development and accelerating digitalization. Indonesia has a large potential in the field of new and renewable energy and the demand for greener and cleaner energies keeps growing remarkably.\par \par \uc2 Attracting green and sustainable investment indeed could bring a greater benefit.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, through digitization, the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector will become a support system for the ongoing agenda of structural reform, creating a more effective and efficient domestic supply chain.\par \par \uc2 All in all, those strategies are concurrent with the results from the success of the recently held G20 Summit in Bali, providing a stepping stone for Indonesia to secure growth momentum.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, Indonesia's 2023 ASEAN chairmanship will present another huge opportunity to scale up regionally on the global challenges and national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  goals.\par \par \uc2 _______________\par \par \uc2 Economist at \uc2 Bank Mandiri\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221122eibm00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Planned bullion bank may be financial system risk: Experts\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 769 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 A new bill currently being deliberated looks set to legalize bullion bank services in the country, but experts warn such a step may carry risks for the country's financial system and are urging the authorities to set up measures to contain the risks.\par \par \uc2 The rules on bullion banking were proposed by the government to be included in the broader financial sector development and strengthening (PPSK) omnibus bill initially drafted by the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The rules would allow for various bullion services involving gold, namely saving, safe deposits, loans and trading, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) exchange, derivative trading and securitization, all of which would be subject to banking law and supervised by the \uc2 Financial Services Authority (OJK)\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Finance Minister \uc2 Sri Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  explained on Nov. 10 that the general concept would be similar to regular banking, but using gold instead of banknotes. She argued that, if one day more people sought to build savings in the form of gold, that should be accommodated.\par \par \uc2 However, experts have told The Jakarta Post that having banks offer bullion services may not be wise\par \par \uc2 Doddy Ariefianto, associate head of the finance program at Binus University, said customers may confuse bullion services with savings and time deposits, falsely assuming that all of them offer stable and guaranteed returns simply because they were all provided by banks.\par \par \uc2 He noted that gold tended to fluctuate and that its price may rise during times of heightened \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  but fall when the situation reverted to normal, earning it the title of a safe-haven asset, rather than a safe asset that offered guaranteed returns.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, he warned it may also lead to mis-selling practices, given that many potential customers still had rather low financial literacy.\par \par \uc2 "If banks are allowed to sell other than their core products, and then something untoward happens, we may expect it to be problematic, unless there is proper customer education," Doddy told the Post, adding that, unfortunately, consumer education was often found wanting.\par \par \uc2 Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Center of \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Law Studies (CELIOS), said that, given the fluctuation in gold prices, authorities would need to take into account risks to banks' balance sheets, which could spill over to the financial system as a whole.\par \par \uc2 Bhima noted that, aside from providing safe deposits for physical gold, bullion banking extended to many derivative products like futures, which were more prone to price fluctuations.\par \par \uc2 "Authorities must watch this closely, because we would not want it to cause systemic risk to the financial system," Bhima said.\par \par \uc2 To prevent such risks, authorities may want to consider limiting the exposure of each bank to bullion banking, or simply restrict such services to the nonbanking industry, he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\uc2  introduced Basel III as a precautionary framework in response to similar concerns about banks' exposure to derivatives, including gold derivatives, by requiring banks to finance long-term assets with enough long-term money to avoid liquidity failures similar to those seen during the 2007/2008 global financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Piter Abdullah, executive director of the Segara Research Institute, said on Monday that banks may provide bullion services but be limited to safe deposits for physical gold in their vaults.\par \par \uc2 Febrio Kacaribu, head of the Finance Ministry's \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency, reassured reporters on Nov. 17 that the country was not new to bullion banking, arguing that several entities had been running such activities, like state-owned sharia lender Bank Syariah Indonesia and state-owned pawnshop Pegadaian.\par \par \uc2 He said there was nothing to be worried about regarding the bullion services and emphasized that their inclusion in the PPSK bill was simply to provide certainty and a legal basis for financial firms running bullion businesses.\par \par \uc2 "Our aim is to provide assurance, so that bullion activities have a legal basis and can be developed further," Febrio said.\par \par \uc2 Vera Febyanthy, a lawmaker from House Commission XI, which oversees the financial services industry, said on Nov. 17 that the deliberation of the bill did not cover risks and concerns about bullion banking, arguing that it would be the OJK's task to address that in the derivative \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  at its own discretion.\par \par \uc2 M. Misbakhun, a fellow lawmaker from the same commission, which oversees the financial system and institutions, said it would push for rules that would address the risks and concerns of bullion banking.\par \par \uc2 "We understand that there is always risk in the financial system. Sometimes, it can be volatile and cramped with \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Misbakhun said on Nov. 17.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221122eibm00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Advertorial: Hong Kong Financial Secretary attends the G20 Summit: Paul Chan: Hong Kong and Indonesia are 'complementary'\b0\par\par\uc2 1,487 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan sees tremendous opportunities for Indonesia and Hong Kong to work together in many ways. This was revealed during his interview with The Jakarta Post during his visit to Bali, Indonesia, to attend the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  (G20) Leaders' Summit (Nov. 15-16) as part of the delegation of the People's Republic of China. The summit provides a platform for leaders of the world's major economies to discuss \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2 , financial, political and other areas for cooperation.\par \par \uc2 "For both Indonesia and Hong Kong, there are tremendous opportunities for us to work together, because we are complementary in many ways," Chan emphasized.\par \par \uc2 Chan said that Hong Kong is a hub for world-class professional and financial services, which can serve Indonesian businesses.\par \par \uc2 "Indonesian businesses can use Hong Kong as a platform to seize the immense opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area), Mainland China as a whole, and even North Asia," he said.\par \par \uc2 Taking the opportunity to visit Indonesia, Chan also met with the Indonesian business sector attending the Business 20 (B20) Summit. Chan met with the Chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN), Arsjad Rasjid, to introduce Hong Kong's latest situation and its institutional advantages under the "one country, two systems" principle. Both sides also discussed the strengthening of bilateral investment and trade-cooperation matters, and exchanged views on the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook of the Asian region and various other topics of mutual interest.\par \par \uc2 KADIN, the largest national industry and business organization in Indonesia, and organizer of this year's B20 Summit, is preparing for a high-level delegation to visit Hong Kong next year to explore opportunities for further cooperation and development.\par \par \uc2 Chan had also met with a few other major local companies to exchange views about regional \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development, potentials of the Indonesian market, and the corresponding opportunities for Hong Kong companies.\par \par \uc2 "We shared with them the updated situation in Hong Kong, and invited them to come over to visit Hong Kong to explore opportunities together. Specifically, we invited them to use our stock exchange as a listing platform. By listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, they are attracting not just international capital and investors, but also those from Mainland China. That would provide a lot more liquidity and strong support for the valuation of their shares," he said.\par \par \uc2 In his meeting with the CEO of PT Indonesia Infrastructure Finance, \uc2 Reynaldi Hermansjah\uc2 , Chan promoted Hong Kong's favorable environment for investment and business, and to explore opportunities for cooperation in green-bond issuance, infrastructure financing and other business areas.\par \par \uc2 At the G20 Summit opening, Chan said, the different leaders shared their thoughts. "I can sense that although the theme of this G20 summit is 'Recover Together, Recover Stronger', there is still a deep political divide. From a Hong Kong standpoint, there would be both challenges and opportunities amid the current situation, including global slowing-down of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , high inflation costs and rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as well as energy and food supply issues," he emphasized.\par \par \uc2 Chan said that 2023 is bound to be a year of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and challenges. On the other hand, he said that there are opportunities, as China is growing very fast and reaching out to other countries, promoting friendship and the spirit of working together.\par \par \uc2 "Asian countries, including ASEAN and Indonesia in particular, are growing very fast, offering a lot of opportunities for investment. Also, I see that Indonesian companies want to go global when they grow, and explore opportunities in countries other than Indonesia. In this regard, Hong Kong offers an opportunity for them to explore the market in Mainland China, in particular the Greater Bay Area," he emphasized.\par \par \uc2 The Greater Bay Area consists of Hong Kong, Macao and 9 cities in the Guangdong province, with a total population of 86 million and aggregate GDP of about US$2 trillion. This scale is equivalent to some of the largest economies in the world like Canada.\par \par \uc2 "That would, on the one hand, present a tremendous consumer market for Indonesian products; on the other hand, Hong Kong, as an international financial center, will be able to offer liquidity and funding to Indonesian companies," Chan said.\par \par \uc2 Chan appreciates and congratulates Indonesia for its success in hosting the G20 Summit, saying that Indonesia is a country of promise.\par \par \uc2 "Having the G20 hosted by Indonesia is great. That brings leaders from all over the globe to this part of the world to see for themselves the prosperity and the opportunities here, in particular Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia is a country of tremendous promise, with a lot of natural resources, an open government which is very friendly to business and investments, and a young population," Chan said.\par \par \uc2 Chan added that ASEAN and the developing parts of Asia contribute about one-third of global growth. Meanwhile, China contributes another one-third. "So, this part of the world will be accounting for about two-thirds of global growth. That is very important and a forceful driver for \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth," he said.\par \par \uc2 Chan said that Hong Kong has now relaxed the quarantine restrictions step-by-step upon subsidence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some major international events have also been organized in Hong Kong, most notably the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in early November. The event was attended by global financial institutions, including their chairmen, CEOs and senior executives, covering asset managers, hedge funds, venture capitalists and private-equity firms. Hong Kong had also successfully hosted the Rugby Sevens.\par \par \uc2 "We organize such large-scale international events to let the whole world know that Hong Kong is back. Hong Kong is back for business. Hong Kong is open," Chan emphasized.\par \par \uc2 "It has been very encouraging for us to continue to open up, to continue to engage with the outside world and to let people know the opportunities in our part of the world," he added.\par \par \uc2 To this end, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee has introduced a series of bold measures to attract talents and businesses in his \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Address announced last month.Chan said that all the measures are intended to attract top-notch talents and businesses from around the world to Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 "We need to attract more talents to come to Hong Kong, because they are the most important asset. That is the reason why we will be rolling out various talent attraction schemes. For example, for those high-income earners -- people earning US$320,000 or more a year, they can come to Hong Kong without the need of getting a job first -- just come explore the opportunities," he said.\par \par \uc2 Another example is for graduates from the top-100 universities with some working experience to come to Hong Kong, regardless of their major. "If the major is philosophy or literature, it is great. If they major in finance or economics, they are also very welcome. They can come in without the need to get a job first -- just explore opportunities to seek employment or set up their business," Chan said.\par \par \uc2 "For those top-school graduates with less experience, we also allow them to come. And finally, we have a talent list. It sets out certain sectors in which we are short on talents. We want to attract such talents to come. Previously, professionals on the talent list needed to first secure job offers before coming.\par \par \uc2 Now this is no longer required -- just come. In Hong Kong, we will be able to offer ample opportunities for these talents," he said.\par \par \uc2 Apart from attracting talents, Hong Kong also wants to attract businesses of strategic value, particularly those from the innovation and technology sector. Such include companies in life science, health science, artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced materials, advanced manufacturing and beyond.\par \par \uc2 "These are the companies we want to attract. So, we introduce an open-door \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  -- come, we can discuss what kind of support or measures we as the government can provide," he said.\par \par \uc2 For those companies that make substantial commitments and investments in Hong Kong, Hong Kong will set up a Co-Investment Fund of around US$4 billion to co-invest into these companies.\par \par \uc2 "The whole idea is to attract more businesses and talents to come to Hong Kong -- to work with us," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I would appeal to Indonesian businesses to come to Hong Kong to see for themselves their opportunities in the city. We are more than happy to do all the facilitation, by setting up meetings and doing business matching with their potential Hong Kong counterparts so that they can work together to seize the opportunities not just in Hong Kong, but also the Greater Bay Area and Mainland China as a whole. We also welcome Indonesian talents to come over and tap the chance to prosper," Chan concluded.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221123eibn00007\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Drained Cash and Job Cuts\b0\par\par\uc2 2,487 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 THREE days after losing his job, Gilang Mahendra started seeking new opportunities. With his status as a former employee of Ruang Raya Indonesia\u8212\'20\'14more commonly known as Ruangguru, a startup company focusing in education\u8212\'20\'14Gilang used the Open-to-Work feature at \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s app. Through the platform of connecting the professionals, he hoped to snatch new work. \u8220\'20\'1CI was fired all of the sudden without any preparation,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Tempo on Friday, November 25.\par \par \uc2 During his two years with Ruangguru, Gilang worked as an account manager for the startup\u8217\'20\'19s Serang branch in Banten. The 28-year-old was shocked to hear about the layoff, but could do nothing but prepare himself to look for a new job. He updated his curriculum vitae and made copies of necessary documents like his diploma, photos, and others.\par \par \uc2 Gilang, a graduate of \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  administration from Banten\u8217\'20\'19s Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University, said he was informed about his job termination on Friday morning, November 18, right after he arrived at work. At 8am he received an email inviting him to a one-on-one meeting with Ruangguru\u8217\'20\'19s head of commercial at 10am. \u8220\'20\'1CIt surprised me as it was unusual for the head of commercial to send a direct email,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 During that 15-minute talk via an online meeting app, Gilang realized that his career with Ruangguru was over. He then discovered that several members of his team had the same fate. Gilang said he was not given the details about the reason for his layoff. \u8220\'20\'1CI only received information that the layoff was necessary for efficiency reasons.\u8221\'20\'1D Not long after, social media was rife with news about Ruangguru\u8217\'20\'19s layoffs. Tempo contacted Ruangguru\u8217\'20\'19s management for comments, but never received a reply.\par \par \uc2 A number of workers at the Ruangguru startup office in South Jakarta, May 2017. TEMPO/Nurdiansah/File Photo\par \par \uc2 Jeje\u8212\'20\'14not her real name\u8212\'20\'14was also a victim of an unexpected layoff. The 28-year-old Shopee Indonesia employee has been working with the marketplace\u8217\'20\'19s promotion for the last one and a half years. But on Monday morning, September 19, Jeje received a message telling her to join a town hall meeting that will take place virtually at 10am. Jeje and some of her friends chose to join the online meeting from Shopee Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s office at Pacific Century Place Tower in South Jakarta\u8217\'20\'19s Sudirman Central Business District. \u8220\'20\'1CAs it happened I made a promise with my colleagues to go to the office that day, so we joined the town hall meeting together,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 When receiving the invitation to the town hall meeting with the director of Shopee Indonesia, Jeje did not think that it would be about a layoff. However, she felt something unusual. According to her, in that meeting, the Director of Shopee Indonesia, Christin Djuarto, acted differently. \u8220\'20\'1CUsually she spoke in Indonesian mixed with English, but that day she was speaking in formal Indonesian, as if she was reading a script that was prepared in advance,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. Jeje also noticed how Christin\u8217\'20\'19s eyes gazed at a single point, \u8220\'20\'1Clike she was reading something.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The meeting lasted less than an hour. There was no question-and-answer session after the meeting, and Christin just said thank you. According to Jeje, the employees then received a follow-up message from Shopee Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s human resources division, asking Jeje and her colleagues to come to its office, which is located in a separate building where she usually worked.\par \par \uc2 The office of Shopee in Jakarta, January 2019.

It had not crossed their minds that the letter marked the end of their career at Shopee Indonesia. Jeje was even still working on some tasks that needed to be done that day. \u8220\'20\'1CWe were thinking that when we met with the human resources department, we still could negotiate to be transferred to a subsidiary, since Shopee is a large group,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 But that thought immediately vanished. Once she arrived at the Shopee office at the Pakuwon Tower, Tebet, South Jakarta, Jeje was asked to sign a number of documents. She was even told to turn in a number of company assets that were loaned to her, like the laptop. \u8220\'20\'1CThere were so many documents I had to sign. I was also given an explanation about the compensation that I would receive. From that day on, I was not allowed to work there,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 Two months after losing her job, Jeje is still unemployed. Fortunately, she said, the severance pay is still enough to pay for her daily needs while she looks for work. \u8220\'20\'1CShopee is also still helping us by giving out our CV to other companies and facilitating training for employees affected by layoffs.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 THE waves of layoffs keep coming at digital startups. In March, farm tech TaniHub closed its warehouses in Bandung (West Java) and Bali, and reduced the number of its employees. Two months later, Fintek Karya Nusantara or LinkAja announced a reorganization that also led to a massive layoff.\par \par \uc2 Not just job cuts, digital startups are collapsing. Take Fabelio for example, which is engaged in the furniture and interior design business. The company was declared bankrupt by the Central Jakarta Commercial Court on October 6, even though just two years earlier Fabelio managed to raise funding of up to US$20 million or Rp300 billion.\par \par \uc2 An atmosphere in LinkAja\u8217\'20\'19s office in the Sudirman area, Jakarta, March 2021. Tempo/Tony Hartawan/File Photo\par \par \uc2 In mid-November, at least three companies reduced the number of its workers: GoTo Gojek Tokopedia or GoTo, Ruangguru, and Sirclo. GoTo announced the layoff of 1,300 employees as part of an \u8220\'20\'1Ceffort to maintain increasingly healthy growth in order to achieve financial independence.\u8221\'20\'1D The strategy, GoTo Chief of Corporate Affairs Nila Marita said, was implemented so that the company could reduce dependence on investors\u8217\'20\'19 funding. \u8220\'20\'1COur strategy is to control the things we can control, including cost efficiency and company operations, although this is a very tough decision,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 According to Nila, before deciding to cut jobs, GoTo\u8217\'20\'19s management first evaluates the costs thoroughly. The company also harmonized operational activities, integrated work processes, and renegotiated various cooperation contracts. That way, GoTo was able to save Rp800 billion at the end of the second quarter of this year. Downsizing, Nila said, was the last effort GoTo resorted to. \u8220\'20\'1CWe announce the decision after ensuring that various aspects have been reviewed thoroughly and prepared carefully.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 According to the company\u8217\'20\'19s unaudited financial report submitted to the \uc2 Indonesia Stock Exchange\uc2  on Monday, November 21, GoTo recorded a net loss of Rp20.91 trillion due to a total expense of Rp30.72 trillion in the third quarter. Employee salaries were one of the largest cost components, with a value of Rp11.28 trillion. The cost of salaries and employee benefits rose more than 100 percent compared to the same period last year, which stood at Rp5.53 trillion. To cope with the bloated burden, the management made savings and renegotiated a series of contracts with third parties.\par \par \uc2 In a copy of the letter sent after the town hall meeting on Friday, November 18, GoTo Chief Executive Officer (CEO) \uc2 Andre Soelistyo\uc2  stated that the company\u8217\'20\'19s financial performances have improved over the last few quarters. Andre said that the company curbed variable costs and tightened operating costs, one way is by cutting the salaries of the CEO and management team. \u8220\'20\'1CBut unfortunately these are not enough,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Andre Soelistyo GoTo Doc.\par \par \uc2 GoTo is not the only tech startup that has to deal with huge operating expenses. It is not a secret that many tech firms have been draining their treasury to pay fantastic salaries to employees, whilst at the same time \u8216\'20\'18burning money\u8217\'20\'19 in order to attract users.\par \par \uc2 Rexi Christopher, Venture Partner at Init-6, said that naturally digital startups are required to have exponential growth. This growth is expected to attract investors and make them race to put money in startups. However, said Rexi, startup founders and management should pay attention to business foundations, and they cannot prioritize growth forever. \u8220\'20\'1COne of the mistakes of several startup founders is that they put too much focus on growth without thinking about a strong business foundation, making them unprepared to face an unfavorable market like today,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Startups are required to save money. As a result, many companies resort to taking away many conveniences and facilities for employees. This happened to Shopee Indonesia. According to one of Shopee Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s employees, Nina, not her real name, conditions began to change following reports that Shopee had closed its operations in India, France, and Spain in mid-2022. At that time, SEA Group\u8212\'20\'14the parent company of Shopee\u8212\'20\'14announced that it would lay off 7,000 employees or 10 percent of its total workforce.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Nina said, Shopee Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s management was still trying to ensure that conditions in Indonesia were different. But lately, various benefits have started to be cut, such as lunch at the office. Snacks and drinks\u8212\'20\'14usually in full stock\u8212\'20\'14are now often unavailable. Even kitchen utensils such as microwaves and refrigerators have also disappeared in some locations.\par \par \uc2 In contrast to the reduction in facilities, Nina continued, Shopee\u8217\'20\'19s management doubled the work target. At the same time, there was a \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  cut off up to 50 percent as the company entered the third quarter. \u8220\'20\'1CAt the time, the management was still saying that layoff was not an option,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 An employee packs goods at a warehouse of Tokopedia, Goto\u8217\'20\'19s e-commerce unit, in Jakarta, August 31. REUTERS/Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana\par \par \uc2 Tempo contacted Shopee Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s management for comments on this information, but there was no response. However, after announcing the layoffs in mid-September, Shopee Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Affairs Head Radynal Nataprawira said that job cuts were a last resort after the company made adjustments and changed a number of business decisions. \u8220\'20\'1CThe global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions require us to adapt more quickly and evaluate business priorities in order to be more efficient. This was a very difficult decision,\u8221\'20\'1D said Radynal.\par \par \uc2 According to Radynal, efficiency is in line with the company\u8217\'20\'19s global focus on achieving independence and sustainability. These two aspects, he said, are crucial for running a business in the midst of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThe company will focus on independent and sustainable business growth, and we want to strengthen and make sure that our company\u8217\'20\'19s operations are stable amidst today\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Shopee\u8217\'20\'19s management ensured that the layoff process will comply with government regulations. Employees who are fired will receive severance pay in accordance with applicable rules plus one month\u8217\'20\'19s salary. Radynal said the company\u8217\'20\'19s health insurance facilities can still be used by employees until the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 INDONESIA is not alone. The waves of layoffs hitting digital startups are also happening in other countries. Global tech giants from the United States such as \uc2 Amazon\uc2  even planned to let go thousands of its employees until next year.\par \par \uc2 The same with \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Since being purchased by \uc2 Tesla\uc2  boss \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has slimmed down drastically, firing 50 percent of its employees. On November 9, \uc2 Facebook\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s parent company Meta Platform Inc. announced the layoffs of 11,000 or about 13 percent of its workforce. Halfway across the globe from the US, China\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Tencent Holdings\uc2  is preparing a second-wave of layoffs after reducing the number of its workers from 116,213 to 110,715 in August.\par \par \uc2 In Southeast Asia, the SEA Group\u8212\'20\'14the parent company of Shopee and gaming platform Garena\u8212\'20\'14plans to fire 7,000 employees or 10 percent of the entire workforce. According to its second-quarter financial report, SEA Group posted a loss of US$931.2 million, twice the value of loss in the same quarter of 2021. The surging loss was attributable to soaring expenses.\par \par \uc2 In addition to slowing business growth and rising labor costs, there are several problems facing digital startups that have forced them to cut jobs massively. Rexi Christopher said that the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil would impact the continuation of funding from investors. \u8220\'20\'1CFundraising will be more difficult because investors tend to wait and see in unstable \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, adding that investors would also be more careful.\par \par \uc2 The sluggish funding from investors is recorded in the State of Venture Q3\u8217\'20\'1922 report released by research institute CB Insights. It reported that the global funding for startups was on a downward trend in the first three quarters of 2022; from US$142.1 billion in the first quarter, down to US$112.6 billion in the second quarter, and further down to US$74.5 billion in the third quarter. The number of investment transactions made also dropped, from 9,587 transactions in the first quarter to 8,771 in the second quarter and just 7,936 in the third quarter.\par \par \uc2 The same thing is happening in Indonesia. The e-Conomy SEA 2022 research by \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Temasek\uc2 , and \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 . stated that digital startup funding has fallen from US$5 billion in the first half of 2021 to US$4 billion the next semester. By June, the value of funding dove deeper to US$3 billion.\par \par \uc2 That is why the chair of Venture Capital Association for Indonesian Startups, Eddi Danusaputro, said that efficiency measures would continue until next year. Companies are facing a lot of pressure\u8212\'20\'14not just from the slow funding, but also decreasing traction or users as well as pressures from investors to immediately make profits. \u8220\'20\'1CAs investors we are concerned about the impact of layoffs, but we understand that the companies need to survive,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Amidst the waves of startup layoffs, which might grow bigger, the \uc2 Indonesian manpower ministry\uc2  stated it encouraged employers and workers to have bipartite dialogues. The goal is to maintain good industrial relations in startup companies, even if in the end layoffs are inevitable.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLayoffs are a last resort when the work relationship between employers and workers can no longer be maintained. As they are a last resort, all parties must try to prevent layoffs,\u8221\'20\'1D said the Ministry\u8217\'20\'19s Director General of Industrial Relations Development and Workers Social Security, Indah Anggoro Putri, on Thursday, November 24.\par \par \uc2 If layoffs are unavoidable, Indah said, companies must undergo all the required procedures and pay for the workers\u8217\'20\'19 rights. Currently, she said, the government is working on \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  options that support the domestic industry\u8217\'20\'19s resilience in the face of a global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil.\par \par \uc2 RIANI SANUSI, WARISSATUL ANBIYA (INTERNS)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817132/817132_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817133/817133_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817134/817134_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817135/817135_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817136/817136_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817137/817137_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020221128eibr0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Minimum Wage Tough Talks\b0\par\par\uc2 1,915 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 November 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 THE meeting of the Wage Council of the West Java Province on Wednesday, November 16, was suddenly stopped. On that second day of meeting, meeting participants were compiling recommendations for the 2023 provincial minimum wage (UMP). As the discussion was stuck, the meeting was stopped. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was really heating up, we eventually stopped it,\u8221\'20\'1D Taufik Garsadi, Head of the West Java Province Manpower and Transmigration Service, told Tempo on Tuesday, November 22.\par \par \uc2 However, Taufik said, the meeting was not stopped because of a heated debate. According to him, the meeting was stopped because there was an order from the manpower ministry. Why? Because the central government was drafting a new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on minimum wages.\par \par \uc2 Taufik actually knew that there would be a new rule when he attended a meeting with the ministry\u8217\'20\'19s Director-General of Industrial Relations Development and Workers Social Security, Indah Anggoro Putri, some time ago. \u8220\'20\'1CThe director-general gathered us and told us that there would be a change. But it was still being discussed by the Wage Council,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Three days later, Ida Fauziyah issued the Manpower Minister \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022 on the determination of the 2023 minimum wage. This new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  pegs the maximum increase in the 2023 minimum wage by 10 percent.\par \par \uc2 Manpower Minister Ida Fauziyah (center) in a working meeting with Commission IX of the DPR, one of which discusses the implementation of the 2023 wage setting based on Law No. 11/2020 on Job Creation, at the Parliament Complex, Senayan, Jakarta, November 8. TEMPO/M Taufan Rengganis\par \par \uc2 Ida explained why she issued the new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which changed the minimum wage formula. Based on growing aspirations, she said, the minimum wage formula regulated in Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36/2021 does not accommodate the impact of the people\u8217\'20\'19s socio-\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions.\par \par \uc2 The minimum wage for 2022, for example, is considered disproportionate to the rate of inflation or rising prices of goods. As a result, the purchasing power of workers decreases. \u8220\'20\'1CWe fear this might happen again in 2023,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ida in a video uploaded to the manpower ministry\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 YouTube\uc2  channel on Saturday, November 19.\par \par \uc2 Changes in the way wage is calculated also took into account people\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions, which have not been fully recovered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Another factor is the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that suppresses the pace of the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  structure is still supported by \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  consumption, which is highly dependent on the level of their salaries. Therefore, the government finds it necessary to maintain people\u8217\'20\'19s purchasing power through changes to the minimum wage formula.\par \par \uc2 The new rule put an end to the heated debate during the West Java Wage Council meeting. Taufik said that on the first day, meeting participants were supposed to discuss the regulations that would be used as the basis for calculating wages.\par \par \uc2 On the second day they began to calculate the value. Employers asked for the calculation of wages to refer to Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36/2021. \u8220\'20\'1CBut workers rejected it,\u8221\'20\'1D said Taufik. In line with the aspirations of workers, representatives from the West Java government also disagreed with the formula in that \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CIf you use this rule, the wage increase will definitely be below the inflation rate.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A protest at the Yogyakarta Province Manpower and Transmigration Agency Office, Sleman, November 22.

ANTARA FOTO/Hendra Nurdiyansyah\par \par \uc2 The Wage Council then makes a minimum wage simulation when referring to Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36/2021. The result was a minimum wage increase of only 6 percent. The problem is, in West Java there is no increase in the regency/city minimum wage (UMK) that is above the provincial inflation rate. The Central Statistics Agency recorded West Java Province\u8217\'20\'19s annual inflation rate in September was 6.12 percent. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are many regencies/cities with minimum wages that are already high that only raise it by 2 to 3 percent. But all of them are below the inflation rate,\u8221\'20\'1D said Taufik.\par \par \uc2 In fact, some regencies/cities are threatened with no wage increase, as their minimum is already above the upper limit set forth in the Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36/2021. Taufik mentioned four regencies with potential of not registering a wage increase, namely Karawang, Bekasi, Bogor, and Purwakarta. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is where the discussion became tough,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 SAID Iqbal was very enthusiastic when hearing that President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  would accept his visit. In September, Jokowi invited the president of the Indonesian Trade Unions Confederation to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, along with Andi Gani Nena Wea, President of the All Indonesian Trade Unions\u8217\'20\'19 Confederation.\par \par \uc2 According to Said, during the meeting Jokowi received him and Andi Gani without being accompanied by ministers, officials, or staff. \u8220\'20\'1C(Perhaps) because Bung Andi Gani asked as a friend,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 Andi Gani is known to have a close relationship with President Jokowi. He was one of the figures who assisted Jokowi in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election as well as the 2014 and 2019 presidential elections. Andi was rewarded with a position as commissioner of Pembangunan Perumahan or PTPP in 2015. A year later, Andi was appointed as the main commissioner and independent commissioner of the state-owned construction company.\par \par \uc2 Said revealed that the meeting with Jokowi was used to convey their ideas of labor unions, especially concerning labor clusters in Law No. 11/2020 on Job Creation. \u8220\'20\'1CWe also discussed vocational training, the Pre-Employment Card program, and other issues.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But, Said added, they talked more about the employment cluster of the Job Creation Law. The reason was because a discussion about the minimum wage by the National Wage Council was about to start. \u8220\'20\'1CWe had hoped that if the (revision) of the Job Creation Law had not been discussed, perhaps the President could issue a discretion concerning the minimum wage increase, a new \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D he explained.\par \par \uc2 At that time, Said said, Jokowi questioned the importance of this discretion. Said, president of the Labor Party, mentioned several reasons. Starting with praise for the government\u8217\'20\'19s success in maintaining positive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth amidst the Covid-19 pandemic and threats of a global recession, Said then mentioned \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s (\uc2 IMF\uc2 ) study that projects Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth of around 5 percent in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Although this figure is lower than the government\u8217\'20\'19s estimate of 5.3 percent, in a report titled World \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Outlook: Countering the Cost-of-Living Crisis released in October, the \uc2 IMF\uc2  stated that Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth next year would be better than several Southeast Asian neighbors. Indonesia is behind Vietnam and Cambodia, whose economies are expected to grow better, at 6.2 percent. The Philippines\u8217\'20\'19 \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth rate is estimated to be the same as Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s, at 5 percent.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 IMF\uc2  also noted that Indonesia is one among 10 countries with the largest gross domestic product (GDP) in the world. Indonesia is in seventh position, overtaking Brazil, England and France. Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s GDP reached US$4.02 trillion based on the purchasing power parity (PPP) approach. The PPP is the comparison of the value of a currency by determining the purchasing power each currency has for buying goods and services in their respective nations. Indonesia is one level below Russia that has a GDP of US$4.46 trillion. \u8220\'20\'1CThis means that there is no reason to say we are facing a recession. We are fine, although we must be on alert,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Under these circumstances, he said that the labor regulations in the Job Creation Law could harm workers. \u8220\'20\'1CWorkers are not enjoying the results of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. Said also said that workers\u8217\'20\'19 wages have barely increased for two consecutive years. \u8220\'20\'1CThe president was shocked.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Previously, there had been reports that the issuance of the Manpower Minister \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022 was the result of a political lobby by trade unions. Said Iqbal and Andi Gani were said to have met with Jokowi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali on November 15-16. The information obtained stated that the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) Chairman Arsjad Rasjid was also present in the meeting.\par \par \uc2 But Said dismissed the rumor, ensuring that there were no meetings with Jokowi or Arsjad in Bali. He said he was in Bali to attend the Labor 20 (L20) meeting as a speaker at the \uc2 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) \uc2 forum. According to the plan, the \uc2 ITUC\uc2  would ask to meet with the President. \u8220\'20\'1CBut Pak Jokowi\u8217\'20\'19s schedule was packed, so it did not happen,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 With or without lobbies, the government finally provided a middle way by issuing Manpower Minister \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022. Trade unions may be happy with the new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . But businessmen are infuriated. Following the issuance of the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo) prepared to file a judicial review to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Hariyadi Sukamdani, Chairman of Apindo\u8217\'20\'19s National Leadership Council, lamented the issuance of the new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  without discussing it first with the National Wage Council and National Tripartite Cooperation Institution forums. He considered the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  contradictory to the hierarchy of statutory regulations.\par \par \uc2 While waiting for the judicial review process, Hariyadi appealed to entrepreneurs to keep referring to Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36/ 2021 during discussions at the Wage Council. Apindo will also file a lawsuit to the State Administrative Court if a governor sets their province\u8217\'20\'19s minimum wage using formulas outside Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36/2021.\par \par \uc2 In Bandung, Apindo West Java Chairperson Ning Wahyu Astutik was still attending the Wage Council meeting at the Gedung Sate on November 22-23. She said that Apindo respects the process of discussing wages properly. She said that she understands that the Wage Council is the official forum to convey Apindo\u8217\'20\'19s rejection of Manpower Minister \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022 as a reference.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur disagreement was recorded in the minutes signed by all members of the tripartite forum present,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ning, who was carrying aid for victims of the Cianjur earthquake when we contacted her on Friday, November 25.\par \par \uc2 Apindo Central Java Chairman Frans Kongi is also consistently attending Wage Council meetings with workers and the government. He is also sticking with Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 36/2021. \u8220\'20\'1CThe position of the government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is higher than a ministerial \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. According to Frans, the ministerial \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  will create legal \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  that will have a poor effect on the investment climate.\par \par \uc2 Later, Kadin addressed the matter. After holding a coordination meeting with dozens of associations of entrepreneurs/companies on Wednesday, November 23, Kadin Chairman Arsjad Rasjid stated that the nanpower minister \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  has created dualism and legal \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CKadin, together with the association of entrepreneurs and all members, are forced to ask for a material review,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CWhatever the outcome, business actors are ready to comply.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo asked representatives of employers and workers to sit together and discuss the minimum wage with a cool head. According to him, a clause that regulates the use of other regulations is needed, for example if companies are unable to implement the Manpower Minister \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022. \u8220\'20\'1CBut good companies must pay well,\u8221\'20\'1D he remarked.\par \par \uc2 RETNO SULISTYOWATI, AHMAD FIKRI (BANDUNG), JAMAL ABDUN NASHR (SEMARANG)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817138/817138_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817139/817139_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/11/28/817140/817140_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020221128eibr00009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FEATURES\par \b \uc2 THE FUTURE OF DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY AMID GLOBAL  \highlight22\uc2 UNCERTAINTY \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 926 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 November 2022\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Indonesian government is optimistic that the domestic manufacturing industry would continue to thrive amid the threat of recession and global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Assistant Deputy for Investment Acceleration Strategy and \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment, Ferry Akbar Pasaribu, stated that the government is not apprehensive about the global prognosis, as opportunities for development of the national manufacturing industry are still wide open.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CRegarding manufacturing, whether you like it or not, you must be smart. We must know the potential for recession but must not be afraid. We have to pay more attention to the manufacturing sub-sectors that have high potential," Pasaribu remarked.\par \par \uc2 At least two industrial sectors in the manufacturing sector, with bright potential going forward, are semiconductors and health.\par \par \uc2 The semiconductor industry is considered crucial, as it is needed in almost all sectors right from mobile phones, laptops, and household furniture, to cars.\par \par \uc2 The chip or semiconductor industry does not have many players and is limited to countries that produce it, such as Taiwan; China, with not-so-successful production; and Japan and Korea, with low production.\par \par \uc2 From these records, Indonesia can reap this potential owing to its large number of locations and much better electricity support.\par \par \uc2 It is not easy to run the chip business, as it is quite expensive, with the special workers\u8217\'20\'19 qualification and advanced infrastructure. Moreover, the factory\u8217\'20\'19s electricity must run round the clock every day.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the health industry is considered prosperous since it will always have a market. These two industries are big and can aid in boosting Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s welfare.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian manufacturing industry continues to experience positive trends, especially during the recovery period, after being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Based on the Making Indonesia 4.0 roadmap, there are seven sectors, including in the development priorities readiness, to enter the industrial 4.0 era, namely the food and beverage, textile and clothing, automotive, electronics, chemical, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries.\par \par \uc2 The non-oil and gas processing industry sector is currently becoming the biggest contributor to the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , at 16.10 percent, while growth of this sector in the third quarter of 2022 reaches 4.83 percent year-on-year (yoy).\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, despite several industrial sectors having recorded brilliant growth performance in the third quarter of 2022, many of them also showed signs of declining in line with the weakening global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Several industrial sectors that grew positively included the base metal industry; machinery and equipment industry; industrial metal goods, computers, electronic goods, optical and electrical equipment to the transportation equipment industry.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, several industrial sub-sectors indicated to have been affected by the weakening global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  were the food and beverage industry, chemical industry, pharmaceuticals and traditional medicines, the non-metallic mineral goods industry, and the furniture industry.\par \par \uc2 Trust in Indonesia\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, amid \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions, national and global manufacturing industry players still place high trust in Indonesia. This is apparent from the realization of investment in the manufacturing industry sector that reached Rp365.2 trillion during the January-September 2022 period.\par \par \uc2 This achievement increased by 54 percent as compared to the same period last year of Rp236.8 trillion.\par \par \uc2 Referring to data from the Ministry of Investment/BKPM, during the January-September 2022 period, the manufacturing industry sector contributed 40.9 percent to the total investment that reached Rp892.4 trillion.\par \par \uc2 Acting Director General of the Chemical, Pharmaceutical and Textile Industry (IKFT) of the Ministry of Industry, Ignatius Warsito, explained that several manufacturing sub-sectors were still growing, although some were slowing due to a decrease in orders from Europe.\par \par \uc2 "The slowdown is due to a decrease in European orders. However, we are still optimistic," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 The Ministry of Industry has also prepared \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  instruments as a short-term solution until early 2023.\par \par \uc2 This measure was taken since the government cannot continue to expect exports since all countries will also attempt to take steps to survive and expand.\par \par \uc2 "We want to see how far the domestic industry is able to withstand this wave of recession. The import substitution \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  has become part of our instrument in the last two years by maintaining the supply of raw and auxiliary materials to help the IKFT sector utilities," he stated.\par \par \uc2 Warsito noted that the industrial sub-sectors that he handles are unique and dynamic, so it should be explored through appropriate handling efforts.\par \par \uc2 However, industrial sub-sectors that are still growing will continue to be encouraged to grow in terms of competitiveness, while those that are slowing down will be guarded to survive.\par \par \uc2 "We are talking about the level of productivity, which we can maintain if the supply of raw materials is not disrupted. The energy used is also maintained, which includes supply and price. We have also assigned our team through the task force ordered by the minister to carry out surveillance in an effort to support the resilience of the IKFT sub-sector industry," he said.\par \par \uc2 Warsito, who concurrently serves as Expert Staff to the Minister of Industry for Capacity Strengthening of the Domestic Industry, also emphasized that the potential for the domestic market must also be strengthened amid \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the export market.\par \par \uc2 The Program to Increase the Use of Domestic Products (P3DN) as well as surveillance through business matching is a short-term solution to meet the supply chains in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RST/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 28-11-2022 12:10:08\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221128eibs00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Financial Services Authority (OJK) has officially extended the credit restructuring \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  until March 31, 2024. The regulator said that this decision was based on the high \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which has risen normalization of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies by the US \b \highlight22\uc2 Central Bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  (The Fed), volatile geopolitics, and high inflation rates.\par \par \uc2 "OJK has adopted a \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to support targeted segments, sectors, industries and regions that require an additional credit/financing restructuring period for one year until March 31, 2024," OJK said in an official statement, Monday, November 28, 2022.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery continues, in line with Indonesia's improving control over the pandemic and the normalization of people's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activities. Most of Indonesia's sectors and industries have returned to strong growth.\par \par \uc2 However, based on the OJK's in-depth analysis, a number of exceptions were found due to the scarring effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Sectors that are eligible to get an extension of credit restructuring are:\par \par \uc2 * The MSME segment, which covers all sectors;\par \par \uc2 * Sector that provides accommodation and food and beverages\par \par \uc2 * Industries that provide large employment opportunities, which are textiles and textile products (TPT) and footwear.\par \par \uc2 This \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is carried out in an integrated manner and applies to banks and finance companies. Meanwhile, existing and comprehensive policies on credit or financing restructuring in the context of Covid-19 pandemic remain valid until March 2023.\par \par \uc2 In its explanation, OJK stated that financial services institutions (LJK) and business actors who still need the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can use it until March 2023. The \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will also remain in effect until the end of the credit/financing agreement between the lenders and the debtors.\par \par \uc2 INTERNSHIP\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo in Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/09/28/id_1144431/1144431_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020221128eibs000gq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 OJK extends loan-restructuring phase for just three sectors\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 729 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Financial Services Authority (OJK) has extended the loan-restructuring program for certain businesses that it believes still require more time to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and to withstand a global slowdown next year.\par \par \uc2 Textile and footwear manufacturers; hotels and restaurants; and businesses classed as micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) will be able to avail themselves of the restructuring program for another year, or until March 2024.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, companies outside of those categories will only be able to take advantage of the program until March 2023.\par \par \uc2 "We have assessed restructured loans for the last two years. Some sectors have recovered, but there are some industries that still need more time," OJK chairman Mahendra Siregar told reporters on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Mahendra added that the deteriorating global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was a certainty next year, which would affect some industries in the country, particularly those with a heavy reliance on exports.\par \par \uc2 He said the OJK would closely monitor these risks and their possible effect on the country's financial sector.\par \par \uc2 The OJK's decision marks the third extension--albeit just for the aforementioned sectors--since the loan-restructuring program was introduced in 2020, during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 The program allows banks to reclassify loans that have deteriorated as a result of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis caused by the pandemic: Loans that would normally be considered "nonperforming" can instead be registered as "loans at risk" (LaR), which helps banks keep their nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios artificially low.\par \par \uc2 Major Indonesian banks have announced that they are prepared for the OJK ending thepolicy, with many having upped their provisioning over the past two years in anticipation of an increase in nonperforming loans should the restructuring program end.\par \par \uc2 State-owned \uc2 Bank Rakyat Indonesia\uc2  (BRI) CEO Sunarso told reporters on Nov. 16 that the lender was well prepared and assured the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  that its provisions were enough to cover all possible nonperforming loans.\par \par \uc2 Sunarso added that the amount of restructured loans in the bank's balance sheet had fallen to just Rp 116 trillion (US$7.38 billion) from around Rp 256 trillion at the height of the pandemic, as more borrowers were better off now and able to pay off their loans.\par \par \uc2 "Should there be any borrowers we can no longer save, it will be no more than 10 percent. Compared to our provisioning at 25.7 percent of outstanding restructured loans, it is actually more than safe," Sunarso said.\par \par \uc2 However, Aviliani, who heads the development and assessment division at the Federation of Private Domestic Banks (Perbanas), said on Nov. 7 that the OJK may want to consider extending the restructuring program not just for selected sectors, arguing that, given the heightened risk and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  next year, all industries would be affected.\par \par \uc2 "So, it does not need to be by sector or by region, because we are facing similar problems. Let banks themselves decide whether they want to give it to certain firms or not," Aviliani told The Jakarta Post.\par \par \uc2 M. Faisal, executive director of the Center of Reform on Economics (CORE) Indonesia, said a survey conducted by the think tank showed that the number of companies reporting a decrease in sales had come down this year but remained higher than those reporting an increase in sales.\par \par \uc2 He said this showed that not all firms had fully recovered from the pandemic, and they may suffer from risks next year, such as a rise in input prices and higher \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For now, the most-apparent sector in trouble may be textiles and footwear, but he said he feared trouble could expand to other industries as well.\par \par \uc2 "We have found that there are still many industries that may not be ready to exit from the loan-restructuring program. Many could still see their performance go down next year," Faisal told the Post.\par \par \uc2 M. Doddy Ariefianto, head of the finance program at Binus University, said on Oct. 27 that the loan-restructuring program was actually not a prudent move for the banking sector, and ending it after three years may be a necessary move to avoid moral hazard.\par \par \uc2 "It's true that we can't just abandon it or cut the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  off right away, but we still need to phase it out, taper it," Doddy said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221128eibs00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Minimum wage hikes upset labor, employers alike\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, London \par \uc2 815 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 November 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The minimum wage hikes recently declared in several major provinces are far from what labor unions had demanded, but it is business associations that are seeking legal recourse.\par \par \uc2 Several provinces announced their 2023 minimum wages on Monday, the last day of a deadline that had been pushed back by a week in a last-minute \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  issued earlier this month, namely Manpower Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022.\par \par \uc2 Jakarta saw a 5.6 percent increase to Rp 4,901,798 (US$311.79), marking the lowest percentage increase among all provinces on Java Island, while the administrations of Banten and West Java increased their minimum wages by 6.4 percent to Rp 2,661,280 and by 7.88 percent to Rp 1,986,670, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Both Banten and West Java are home to satellite cities and regencies of Greater Jakarta, such as Tangerang, Bogor, Bekasi and Depok.\par \par \uc2 East Java, meanwhile, saw a 7.86 percent increase to Rp 2,040,244, but the highest relative increase among Java provinces was in Central Java, where Governor Ganjar Pranowo raised the basic pay by 8.01 percent to Rp 1,812,935.\par \par \uc2 "We have already had talks with employers and workers to find a middle ground," Ganjar told reporters on Monday.\par \par \uc2 "They [workers] are actually willing to negotiate."\par \par \uc2 Labor Party chairperson Said Iqbal said on Monday that the party opposed the rate increase due to the percentage hike being lower than the sum of inflation and gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which are estimated at 6.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Said told reporters he believed that using data from September of this year and comparing that to September last year to assess inflation failed to capture the full impact of the increase in administered fuel prices conducted in September this year, much of which had only begun to show up in the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in October.\par \par \uc2 "The rise in minimum wages all over Indonesia should [equal] inflation and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in provinces and cities or regencies in the current year, instead of using a year-on-year basis," he said.\par \par \uc2 Said singled out the 5.6 percent minimum wage increase in Jakarta as being "insensitive to the lives of workers" by being lower than the national average estimate and not covering the basic living\par \par \uc2 expenses in the city.\par \par \uc2 The party estimates the basic labor living cost in the capital at Rp 3.7 million, consisting of renting a house in the city for a month at around Rp 900,000, transportation costs of Rp 900,000, food consumption at food stalls of Rp 1.2 million, electricity consumption of Rp 400,000 and communication \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Rp 300,000.\par \par \uc2 "Is this enough to pay for clothes, drinking water, neighborhood fees and other necessities?" Said continued.\par \par \uc2 To that end, the Labor Party demanded that the minimum wage hike in Jakarta be upped to 10.55 percent. Previously, the party had pushed for a 13 percent increase.\par \par \uc2 "If our demands are not met, starting from next week, there will be large demonstrations in various areas of Indonesia," Said added.\par \par \uc2 Businesses, on the other hand, are also dissatisfied with the rate increases apparently derived from the new formula stipulated in the Manpower Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Indonesia Employers Association (Apindo) filed a petition with the Constitutional Court on Monday for a judicial review of that \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  based on the fact that the minimum wage formula in that was different from Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  (PP) No. 36/2022.\par \par \uc2 Apindo requested that the court declare Manpower Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022 void because of the conflict with PP No. 36/2022.\par \par \uc2 "We ask the Constitutional Court to quickly decide on the review due to its importance for business continuity in the country," Apindo lawyer Denny Indrayana said.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) also decided to file a petition for a review with the court after a meeting with various business associations on Nov. 23.\par \par \uc2 Kadin argues that Manpower Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No.18/2022 created ambiguity though regulatory dualism and legal \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Whatever the result is, businesses are ready to comply," Kadin chairman Arsjad Rasjid said on Nov. 25.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia Development and Islamic Studies (IDEAS) director Yusuf Wibisono said on Tuesday that the moves by several governors to use Manpower Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 18/2022 instead of PP 36/2021 was "not appreciative of labor productivity".\par \par \uc2 He said the minimum wage increase of around 6 to 8 percent was a "middle way" amid the need to ensure workers' purchasing power but at the same time be mindful of businesses affected by the global slowdown, such as export-oriented industries.\par \par \uc2 "The minimum wage increase in 2023 could, at the very least, compensate for inflation, which is projected to be between 6 percent and 8 percent," Yusuf told TheJakartaPost.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221129eibt00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Global issues proved to be a source of headache for leaders who participated in the G20 Summit and left them with lined faces and graying hair, President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  joked during a meeting here on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The G20 Summit was held from November 15\u8211\'20\'1316 this year.\par \par \uc2 "I conclude that everyone is confused, everything is confusing, I see all the wrinkles on their face here, their hairs are getting more gray, and indeed, this global situation has no certainty, no confirmation," he remarked at the \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  Annual Meeting here.\par \par \uc2 The leaders of G20 nations comprise 19 heads of state and one leader of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . G20 countries account for 85 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP).\par \par \uc2 Widodo said that the current global situation is still rife with \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and complexity, and has grown even more difficult to predict. In fact, no one can guess the direction of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  with confidence, he added.\par \par \uc2 "For example, just one: oil price. Who can determine? I asked the big oil producers, they could not predict, and would be capped. The price of oil is even more difficult; how will it be calculated later?\u8221\'20\'1D he asked.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, everyone must be optimistic, but at the same time, remain vigilant, he said. As an example, he cited the need to anticipate export performance because, for the coming year, there are predictions of an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown for Indonesia"s trading partners, such as China, the United States, and the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In addition, the normalization of the US monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is also expected to restrict the pace of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in that country. This will affect demand for US imports, which, in turn, will also affect exports from Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 "Our exports there are also very huge, our exports to China are very huge, to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is also so huge. So be careful," he cautioned.\par \par \uc2 The head of state also asked that the investment climate continue to be improved so that the ever-increasing investment target can be achieved. All parties must also maintain household consumption, which has a large influence on \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 "Our \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  GDP is very much affected, very large related to consumption. We have to change this little by little so that consumption can go into production," he said.\par \par \uc2 During a meeting with volunteer groups here on November 26, Widodo had said that graying hair and wrinkles are physical characteristics of leaders who care about the people.\par \par \uc2 His comments about leaders\u8217\'20\'19 physical characteristics became a hot topic among citizens, who associated them with several figures who are expected to become presidential candidates in the 2024 election.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-MCA/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 30-11-2022 18:41:11\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221130eibu0018j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Discourse: Indonesia can downstream its way out of middle-income trap\b0\par\par\uc2 981 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 As Indonesia continues to build downstream industries, it faces multiple challenges in becoming a developed country. Investment Minister \uc2 Bahlil Lahadalia\uc2  spoke to The Jakarta Post's Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, Adisti Sukma Sawitri and M. Taufiqurrahman about investment prospects in 2023 and how the country had devised its strategy.\par \par \uc2 Question: What is the current state of investment in Indonesia?\par \par \uc2 Answer: Even though the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is full of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , we should be grateful that there is still a glimpse of hope for Indonesia to be better. In the second quarter, Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth was the best among the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  member countries.\par \par \uc2 In accordance with the direction of President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2 , the main direction of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  transformation is downstreaming [commodities sectors]. When I joined in 2019, base metals and processed metals, a key downstreaming sector, only accounted for 7.6 percent of total realized investment in the year, the fourth-largest sector. It became number one in 2021, accounting for 13 percent. In 2022, it is still number one, accounting for 14.8 percent of total investment.\par \par \uc2 There is now integration between mining sites and industrial areas and clusters. We are really pushing for the creation of added value because downstreaming is Indonesia's key to get out of the middle-income trap. It is the path to becoming a developed country.\par \par \uc2 What is the investment outlook for next year, given the global recession projection?\par \par \uc2 As a former entrepreneur, I believe that every time there is a problem, there is an opportunity. If there is no problem, then the opportunity is narrow. And who can take advantage of that opportunity? Only experienced people.\par \par \uc2 As long as I am still investment minister, downstreaming will remain the most important thing. Because it is the only way for us to become a developed country, and we must remain consistent with this \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I am confident because, in the future, people will all talk about green energy products and green industry. And Indonesia has extraordinary natural resources, including nickel.\par \par \uc2 In almost all countries, by 2030, the majority of cars will be electric. For an electric car, 40 percent of the components are batteries, and most of the battery components are made of nickel. Nickel, manganese and cobalt are available in Indonesia, but lithium is not.\par \par \uc2 So, if we can tap into that potential by continuing to use renewable energy in an environmentally friendly way, then our country will be [a major industry] player.\par \par \uc2 I also believe that entrepreneurs should not regulate the state, but the state regulates entrepreneurs. However, the state cannot be arbitrary.\par \par \uc2 What's the key? Collaboration --collaboration between countries and collaboration between entrepreneurs and the state.\par \par \uc2 Am I optimistic? I am. But with one condition, political stability.\par \par \uc2 Could you elaborate on the issue of political stability and leadership?\par \par \uc2 During the transition of leadership from former president [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono] to President Jokowi, the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was not dark. It was like a car driving on a smooth road, no potholes.\par \par \uc2 Starting from 2023, because the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is dark, the road will be full of potholes. The [global impact of the] trade war between China and the United States has been worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine. Political tension in [Asia] has also simmered due to China and Taiwan.\par \par \uc2 I hope nothing happens, as this condition impacts the health of the car. As a former \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  transportation driver myself, I know that an inexperienced driver would struggle to drive on a road full of potholes.\par \par \uc2 Now we are at a crossroads. One way leads to safety and the other leads to a ravine.\par \par \uc2 A driver with poor intuition would damage the car because of the difficulties of avoiding the potholes while leading the car into the ravine. If this happens, it's not only the driver who dies, the passengers also die. So that's why we need an experienced driver.\par \par \uc2 In fact, in my opinion, either we'll arrive at our destination safely but it will take a bit of time to prepare, or we'll to rush toward it but not survive and fall into the abyss.\par \par \uc2 What progress has been made on the clean power export ban?\par \par \uc2 I would like to convey that the direction of state \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in promoting renewable energy is an absolute obligation because our target is that by 2025, 25 percent of our electricity consumption must come from renewables.\par \par \uc2 So if our country's production is not enough for consumption, why are we exporting it? It's like a family that gives its rice to others while their own members are not being well fed.\par \par \uc2 So as long as I am the minister of investment and still carry out the orders of President Jokowi, renewable energy exports to the world will not be allowed in Indonesia until the needs of our country are met.\par \par \uc2 How will this impact investment in renewable energy in Indonesia?\par \par \uc2 If you want to build [renewable energy power plants], then just build them. We often get intimidated too easily. In the past, when we wanted to ban the export of nickel ore, we were told that the state's income would be lost, it turned out to be otherwise.\par \par \uc2 The more fearmongers stand in the way, the more I'm sure that we are on the right track. Many investors want to build renewable infrastructure in this republic because our future consumption is high. People who want to build industries definitely need renewables. It is only people who don't produce products who don't want to invest in renewables.\par \par \uc2 We need cooperation with them, but in a form that is mutually beneficial. We can't let their profits be big with a small profit for us in exchange.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221130eibu00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

This is very important," President Jokowi noted at the State Palace, Jakarta, Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi remarked that the threat of rising inflation would become one of the challenges for the domestic and global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  next year. Hence, regional heads are urged to work hard to control the supply and stock of goods and services in their respective regions.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is the scourge of all countries.

Once again, pay attention to the movement of the inflation rate in each region," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 In addition to regional heads, Jokowi urged ministries and non-ministerial institutions (K/L) to accelerate the realization of \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially capital and social \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  and 2023 State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I ask to speed up the realization of \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Jokowi noted.\par \par \uc2 The head of state called on all ministries and institutions as well as regional governments to be sensitive to crises and to always be alert to global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Jokowi stressed that central and regional government officials should understand that currently the world is facing unfavorable conditions.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEveryone must be really prepared for all the various possibilities that might occur, which we did not predict, which we did not calculate. (Thus, one is) not only able to survive but also able to take advantage of every opportunity that exists,\u8220\'20\'1C he stated.\par \par \uc2 The 2023 state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  (APBN), agreed upon by the government and the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR), includes state \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Rp3,016.2 trillion and state revenue of Rp2,463.0 trillion, with a \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Rp 598.2 trillion, or 2.84 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\par \par \uc2 Statistics Indonesia (BPS) earlier reported that inflation in November 2022 had reached 0.09 percent as compared to the previous month (month-to-month/mtm) that was contributed by an increase in the price of eggs for purebred chickens, with a 0.02-percent share.\par \par \uc2 "Inflation on a monthly basis occurred, as there was an increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), from 112.75 in October 2022 to 112.85 in November 2022," Deputy for Distribution and Services Statistics at BPS Setianto remarked.\par \par \uc2 With inflation of 0.09 percent (mtm) last month, annual inflation reached 5.42 percent as compared to the same period last year (year-on-year/yoy), and in comparison with December 2021, it reached 4.82 percent (year-to-date/ ytd).\par \par \uc2 Apart from purebred chicken eggs, Setianto highlighted the increase in prices of commodities -- filter cigarettes, tomatoes, gold jewelry, rice, raw tempeh, and tofu -- that contributed to monthly inflation.\par \par \uc2 The price of purebred chicken eggs was the biggest contributor to inflation in November 2022 on a monthly basis, which is due to increased demand. The price of purebred chicken eggs rose by 2.77 percent (mtm) and 17.11 percent (yoy) to an average of Rp27,476 per kilogram.\par \par \uc2 Based on the group, the biggest contributor to the November 2022 inflation on a monthly basis was the personal care and other services group that experienced an inflation of 0.44 percent (mtm), with a share of 0.03 percent.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, based on the distribution of regions, Setianto said that as many as 62 cities out of 90 CPI cities experienced inflation, with the highest occurring in Ambon City, at 1.15 percent (mtm), due to rising filter cigarette prices, with a share of 0.32 percent; air transport, 0.09 percent; and tempeh, 0.08 percent.\par \par \uc2 "The deepest deflation occurred in Tanjung Pandan by 0.64 percent (mtm) due to rising prices for broiler meat, with a share of 0.19 percent; red chili and cayenne pepper, each 0.09 percent; and air transportation, 0.02 percent," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/H-SHT/H-SHT) 01-12-2022 17:39:52\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221201eic1000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 BUSSINESS\par \b \uc2 KPPU TO BOLSTER SUPERVISION OF MSME PARTNERSHIPS\b0\par\par\uc2 347 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 December 2022\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The \uc2 Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) \uc2 will strengthen the supervision of partnerships involving micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as part of efforts to prepare for the threat of a global recession in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Strengthening the supervision of MSME partnerships will be one of the commission"s focuses in 2023 due to the good resilience of MSMEs against recession and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil, KPPU head M. Afif Hasbullah said at a media gathering here on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "MSMEs (contribute) 61 percent to the GDP (gross domestic product) and absorb 97 percent of the workforce. Thus, the KPPU needs to back up the partnership supervision; do not let our MSMEs be controlled by big business actors amid times of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he added.\par \par \uc2 Apart from strengthening the supervision of MSME partnerships, in 2023, the KPPU will also seek to boost the compliance of business players with healthy business competition principles.\par \par \uc2 "The posture of the KPPU"s activities in the future is not only about law enforcement. Law enforcement is the final action.

President Joko \u8220\'20\'1CJokowi\u8221\'20\'1D Widodo has called for resuming vigilance over inflation as the price increase rate eased to a three-month low in November.\par \par \uc2 The consumer price index - a broad basket of goods and services prices - rose 5.42 percent from the same month a year ago, a slower pace from 5.71 percent in October food and service prices increase eased, the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) announced on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 That was also below the market consensus of 5.5 percent. Core consumer prices\u8212\'20\'14which excludes volatile food and government-administered prices\u8212\'20\'14rose by 3.30 percent last month.\par \par \uc2 On a monthly basis, consumer prices picked up 0.09 percent over the past month, rebounding from a 0.11 percent fall in October and beating expectations of a 0.16 percent increase.\par \par \uc2 Still, President Joko \u8220\'20\'1CJokowi\u8221\'20\'1D Widodo reminded the regional government to remain vigilant in reining in the inflation in their respective regions to shield Indonesia from the fallout of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I ask you, regional governments, governors, mayors, to pay attention to the inflation rate movements from time to time, hour to hour, in your respective regions. This is very important. [Inflation] has become the scourge of all countries," Jokowi said during an event with the regional government leaders on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Spiking inflation in Southeast Asia's largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the past few months has forced its \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s hand to increase its benchmark interest rate, risking slowing down the country\u8217\'20\'19s post-pandemic recovery.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi said the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  prospect has become more \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2 , so it was crucial to ensure Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  fundamentals, including inflation, remain robust.\par \par \uc2 The regions today were still grappling with the impacts of the fuel price increase in September to rising logistics and transportation costs, Setianto, the deputy head of goods and services at BPS, said.\par \par \uc2 For example, Tanjung Selor, North Kalimantan\u8217\'20\'19s capital, saw the highest inflation rate in November among the 90 cities surveyed by the statistics agency. The city\u8217\'20\'19s inflation rate accelerated to 9.2 percent last month from 9.1 percent a month earlier.\par \par \uc2 Setianto said high airfare remained the culprit for the persistently high inflation in the city.\par \par \uc2 Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara, and Jember in East Java followed behind Tanjung Selor with high inflation rates of 6.89 percent and 7.42 percent, respectively.\par \par \uc2 On the bright side, price increases for several goods and services have eased in November. \u8220\'20\'1CLooking at all of the contributing components, volatile food prices contributed to November 2022 inflation slowing down,\u8221\'20\'1D Setianto said.\par \par \uc2 Food inflation, which accounts for 27.6 percent of last month's inflation, has eased to a sixth-month low of 5.87 percent in November from 6.76 percent in October.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, prices rose at a slower pace for transport, housing, furnishings, and dining out. Prices of both education and clothing continued to accelerate.\par \par \uc2 Cost of information & financials was the only cost component dropping further in November, declining by 0.40 percent last month, compared to a 0.42 decline in November.\par \par \uc2 Document JGLOBE0020221202eic200007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 G20 still relevant but \uc2 G7\uc2  should be 'open to change'\b0\par\par\uc2 A. Muh. Ibnu Aqil, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 932 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 After the dust has settled on Indonesia's turbulent yet successful \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  presidency this year, analysts suggest that the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  forum and its influential \uc2 Group of Seven\uc2  clique remain important as multilateral tools for addressing the world's biggest challenges.\par \par \uc2 However, future progress would be contingent on whether the \uc2 G7\uc2  is open to change, listens to the concerns of other G20 member states and is willing to regain their trust.\par \par \uc2 The Ukraine conflict, which started with Russia's invasion in February, dominated the two-day G20 Summit in Bali last month, to the frustration of members that wanted more attention on global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  woes.\par \par \uc2 But the forum had managed to push out a much-awaited joint communiqu? and several other negotiated texts that are expected to inform the world on how to emerge from a crippling global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  downturn, despite concerns the war had resulted in an irreconcilable split within the G20.\par \par \uc2 Some observers called it a "success on all accounts", while others tempered their expectations and pointed to the fact that the convening of world leaders on the Island of the Gods was in itself a feat amid global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Isabel Weininger, a senior \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  advisor on Southeast Asia from the \uc2 Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung\uc2  (KAS) German think tank, pointed to Indonesia's convening power as proof that "diplomacy still works".\par \par \uc2 She noted that the G20 and the \uc2 G7\uc2 , which Indonesia and Germany chaired this year, respectively, used different but complementary approaches in diplomacy, which ultimately led to the success of this year's G20 proceedings.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 G7\uc2 , comprising well-established and industrialized economies, was all about coming up with a united voice, while the G20 was about providing an inclusive forum.\par \par \uc2 Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States are among the \uc2 G7\uc2  member states, while the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is a "non-enumerated member".\par \par \uc2 "The G20 is really inclusive, giving voices to many developing countries and emerging powers and bringing them to the table - and not on the menu," Weininger said at a panel discussion cohosted by KAS and the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (\uc2 CSIS\uc2 ) on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 New world order\par \par \uc2 Criticism of the G20 over the past few years has centered on its inherently exclusive nature of convening the world's biggest economies, but this year Indonesia made it a point to represent the interests of the developing world, whose population largely live on the whims of the few that dictate the direction in which the world moves.\par \par \uc2 For instance, G20 members agreed at last month's summit to pursue efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, including speeding up efforts to phase down the unabated use of coal. But it remains to be seen whether \uc2 G7\uc2  nations would make good on their climate financing pledges.\par \par \uc2 As it stands, the \uc2 G7\uc2  and the G20 are seemingly pulling the global rules-based order in different directions, said Manjeet Kripalani, executive director of India's Gateway House think tank.\par \par \uc2 While the \uc2 G7\uc2  is composed of "rule makers" who want to preserve the status quo, other G20 states want to create global rules that are more flexible and\par \par \uc2 accessible to all.\par \par \uc2 But now the onus is on the \uc2 G7\uc2  to show good faith and regain the trust of other G20 members by fulfilling its promises on climate financing, lest it wants to preserve some of the post-war world order it created, she said.\par \par \uc2 "Don't begrudge the new world from writing equitable, inclusive and transparent new rules for a bright global future. Instead, sit at the same table and make these new rules jointly," the analyst said during Tuesday's talks.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia was the first of a run of G20 presidents from the world of emerging economies. New chair India, successor Brazil and the subsequent president South Africa, which takes over in 2025, will complete the first rotation series.\par \par \uc2 In an interview published in The Jakarta Post's special edition the "G20 Digest", Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi made it clear that Indonesia hoped its work and focus on the interests of developing and least developed nations would find continuity in the next few G20 presidencies.\par \par \uc2 Indian Prime Minister \uc2 Narendra Modi\uc2 , who oversees his nation's G20 presidency, stated in a Thursday declaration in Indian newspapers that India would aim to depoliticize the global supply of food, fertilizer and medical products so that geopolitical tensions did not lead to global disruptions.\par \par \uc2 'Overextended'\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, some analysts bemoaned the loss of focus at this year's G20 meetings, compared with earlier years that had given the forum its clout for managing global crises.\par \par \uc2 Senior economist Djisman Simandjuntak, who is also chair of the board of directors for CSIS Indonesia, noted how the first three summits of the G20, from 2008 to 2009, were "very effective" in managing the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis, compared with more recent summits.\par \par \uc2 Djisman said the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  forum was no longer "productive" due to it being overextended by the breadth of topics and issues that it had to address.\par \par \uc2 "What is more useful is to convene the G20 whenever there is a crisis, rather than addressing everything every time the G20 meets," Djisman said during the discussion.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's G20 presidency issued a sprawling 1,186 pages of outcome documents, comprising the G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration, several communiqu?s and chair summaries, as well as pages of notes and annexes detailing the work produced throughout the year.

It was only right that the government granted this status to stop indigenous people in Papua continually being sidelined by the aggressive expansion of oil palm and mining corporations.\par \par \uc2 The environment and forestry ministry handed over the written decision regarding the customary forest at the Nusantara Indigenous People\u8217\'20\'19s Congress in October. They had had to wait for decades to obtain this legal certainty despite the fact that the Papuan Special Bylaw on the collective rights of indigenous people and the individual rights of indigenous people to land was issued in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Through this customary forest scheme, people can independently manage forests as living and social spaces. The customary forest designation is a solution that protects indigenous communities from conflicts with companies extracting natural resources and taking over the living space of indigenous people. But the fact is that the ministry has only officially designated around 40,000 hectares as customary forest in Papua despite the total area in the region registered with the Ancestral Domain Registration Agency (BRWA) exceeding two million hectares.\par \par \uc2 Natural resources in Papua have long been a tempting target for investment. The problem is that investment there is entirely oriented towards \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, is extractive and sidelines indigenous people who depend on the forest for their livelihoods. Marginalization and the destruction of habitats become the root of conflict between indigenous people and corporations in Papua.\par \par \uc2 It is not only in Papua that the government has been late in issuing customary forest written designations. Nationally, only a very small area has been designated as customary forest. As of October 2022, the environment and forestry ministry had only designated 148,488 hectares of customary forest for 105 communities, although the total area of customary forest in Indonesia registered with the BRWA was 20.7 million hectares as of August this year.\par \par \uc2 Apart from a lack of commitment, the main cause of the problem is the complexity of the government\u8217\'20\'19s own policies. Article 67 of Law No. 41/1999 on forests requires a bylaw on indigenous people as the basis for designating customary forests.\par \par \uc2 In practice, indigenous communities who know very little about politics are often forced or trapped into involvement in transactional politics. Besides this, because the process of producing bylaws takes such a long time, in many places, indigenous people and those assisting them simply give up because of exhaustion.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, indigenous people face further \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  if regional heads or \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  councils do not have any commitment towards or take no responsibility for the establishment of indigenous people bylaws. In general, opportunistic politicians do not want to work too hard because their political calculations tell them that indigenous people are unable to provide a significant number of votes.\par \par \uc2 Funding support from the state for participative mapping\u8212\'20\'14as a technical condition for the proposal of a customary area\u8212\'20\'14is also severely limited. In West Papua, for example according to the Papua Arrow Union, dozens of indigenous people have submitted requests for customary forests, but their efforts have been halted by the limited allocation of government funds for verifications on the ground.\par \par \uc2 If this continues, when will indigenous people be free to manage their own living and social spaces?\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/12/05/817841/817841_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020221205eic500003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Advertorial: BI projects "an optimistic, but cautious" 2023 for Indonesia's  \highlight22\uc2 economic \highlight\uc2  growth\b0\par\par\uc2 1,060 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Jakarta Post,\par \par \uc2 In the midst of a turbulent global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  condition, Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is showing resilience and upbeat prospects. \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 projects that the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in 2023 will remain strong in the 4.5-5.3 percent range and inflation will return within 3.0?1 percent. The forecast was announced at this year's Annual Meeting of \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (PTBI), which was held via hybrid meeting on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is predicted to continue rising in the 4.7-5.5 percent range in 2024 supported by private consumption, investment and positive export trends amid the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 's slowing growth.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) is expected to abate within the 3.0?1 percent range in 2023 and 2.5?1 percent range in 2024. Core inflation is also expected to revert back sooner in the first half of 2023. It will be achievable with controlled import inflation prices against a stable rupiah exchange rate and a monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that is front loaded, pre-emptive and forward looking.\par \par \uc2 "I agree that we must be optimistic, but we also need to be cautious and alert for [2023]," said President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  in his remarks, reminding all that the global condition remains unpredictable in the future.\par \par \uc2 While optimism is greatly deserved, caution must also be taken against the ripple effect caused by global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , including the risk of stagflation (\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown and high inflation) and even reflation (\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recession and high inflation).\par \par \uc2 Another consideration is the risk of a correction in world and regional \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, should political and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  fragmentations continue. The tightening of monetary policies might also take longer to reduce inflation in each country.\par \par \uc2 However, BI observed that successful control over the inflation rate was also in part due to close \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  coordination with the central and regional governments through Central and Regional Inflation Control teams (TPIP and TPID) and the National Movement for Food Inflation Control (GNPIP).\par \par \uc2 Seeing the results that inter-institutional collaboration yielded, \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2 , BI governor, emphasized synergy and innovation as the key to the revival and resilience of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023 and 2024 as the country faces global turmoil.\par \par \uc2 Synergy and Innovation\par \par \uc2 In his remarks, the BI governor mentioned synergy as being derived from an understanding between institutions to optimally achieve their common goal for the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , namely a balance between stability and growth. From this agreement, a favorable \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix can be formulated, both in terms of the complementarity of \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  instruments and the effectiveness of their transmission.\par \par \uc2 The 2023 BI \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix focuses on fortifying the resilience, recovery and revival of the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  through tightly-knit synergies with national policies.\par \par \uc2 To that end, BI's monetary policies are directed to be pro-stability in order to reach inflation goals and stabilize the national currency exchange rate while supporting macroeconomic stability and the financial system. Meanwhile, BI's four other policies are intended to be part of a collaborative pro-growth effort to restore the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The pressure on exchange rates, monetary stability and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  and financial system is increasing due to outflows of portfolio investment, especially from government securities (SBN) due to high-risk perception and the "cash is king" perception among global investors.\par \par \uc2 To mitigate the monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  trilemma against the ripple effect created by global turmoil, BI will optimize three monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  instruments. They include interest rate \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , stabilization of the rupiah exchange rate, a twist operation.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  will continue selling short-term tenor SBN and purchasing long-term SBN on the secondary market when necessary. I will maintain a positive SBN yield in portfolio investment that can support the stabilization of the Rupiah while preventing an excessive SBN yield for \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  financing. \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  will also continue to closely coordinate with the Finance Ministry.\par \par \uc2 The bank will also resume pursuing its interest rate \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  response through well-calibrated, well-planned and well-communicated plans to ensure early achievement of the core inflation target, particularly in the first half of 2023.\par \par \uc2 Relaxed macroprudential policies will encourage bank credit and financing for priority sectors and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It will also work to maintain the stability of the financial system as well as develop a green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and financial inclusion.\par \par \uc2 Regarding payment systems, BI plans to accelerate their digitization in accordance with the Indonesian Payment System Blueprint (BSPI) 2025 to create platforms made for one language, one nation and one country. BI aims to accelerate the integration of digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and finances, collaboration in cross-border payment, as well as a the development of Digital Rupiah in line with the publication launched during the 2022 PTBI.\par \par \uc2 BI will also pursue an accelerated deepening of the money market and foreign exchange market according to the 2025 Money Market Development Blueprint (BPPU). Aside from optimizing the effectiveness of \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  operations and transmission, it will also develop a modern and international-standard money market as well as developing financial instruments, including sustainable finance.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, BI has made plans to expand and strengthen inclusive and green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies. As one of the pillars of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , MSMEs will be targeted to Go Export and Go Digital. Meanwhile, BI also continues to stimulate the increasing role of Sharia \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and finance as a new source of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  also reinforces international cooperation with central banks and other partner national authorities in the financial sectors. Close synergy with the government has also been pursued to ensure the success of Indonesia's chairmanship in ASEAN 2023, especially in financial integration.\par \par \uc2 "[With] strong synergy in the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix, \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2 -monetary coordination, accelerated transformation in the real and financial sectors, as well as innovation and acceleration of the digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and finance, Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  prospects are showing positive trends," remarked the BI governor.\par \par \uc2 On this occasion, BI also granted the 2022 \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  Award to 58 strategic partners from the banking sector, corporations and individuals as an appreciation for their support in carrying out BI's programs throughout 2022. The award also reflects the synergy between BI and strategic partners,including the government, \uc2 Financial Services Authority (OJK) \uc2 and the Indonesian Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS).\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221205eic50000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  has said that synergy and collaboration among the central government, regional governments, and other parties will be essential for facing \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  next year.\par \par \uc2 "The world is indeed in turmoil. The key is synergy and collaboration, unity, togetherness, mutual cooperation, harmony, and coordination. If we unite, governors, district heads, central government, we can face the 2023 \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he said.\par \par \uc2 He made the statement while speakingat the \u8220\'20\'1CNational Coordination Meeting of the Regional Digitalization Acceleration and Expansion Teams (TP2DD)" that ANTARA followed online on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 He expressed the hope that, through synergy and collaboration, the national \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will grow above five percent year on year (yoy) in 2023 despite \uc2 IMF\uc2  projections of slow global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in the range of 2\u8211\'20\'133 percent yoy.\par \par \uc2 Warjiyo said that the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown projected for next year would be a follow-up effect of Russia"s invasion of Ukraine, which has disrupted global supply chains after the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby increasing the inflation rate in several developed countries.\par \par \uc2 It has been followed by the tightening of monetary policies in several developed countries, which have aggressively raised their benchmark rates, and this, in turn, has affected \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, he asked all parties in Indonesia to remain optimistic about facing 2023 while staying alert.\par \par \uc2 "As long as we continue to synergize between central and regional (governments)," he added.\par \par \uc2 At Tuesday"s event, he also lauded the performance of regional governments and TP2DD task forces that have accelerated and expanded digitalization, thereby, helping increase regional revenues.\par \par \uc2 He noted that digitalization can push national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 "(For) regional governments who succeeded in carrying out TP2DD, their revenue is increasing, the \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  is accelerating, the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is growing better, and the people are happy," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RAP/A/R013/R013) 06-12-2022 16:09:54\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221206eic6000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 BI sees rupiah at turning point in 2023\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 822 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The rupiah is likely to take an unexpected turn toward appreciation against the US dollar in 2023, resulting in lower imported inflation, both \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 officials and economists projected.\par \par \uc2 In a forum held by the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) on Tuesday, BI estimated that in the baseline scenario, the Indonesian currency would strengthen significantly after the first quarter of next year (Q1/2023).\par \par \uc2 According to data from state-owned lender \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2 , the rupiah had appreciated by 1.7 percent month-to-date (mtd) or depreciated by 8.5 percent year-to-date (ytd) to Rp 15,468 per US dollar, rising from the depreciation of 10.4 percent ytd on Nov. 30.\par \par \uc2 On Nov. 30, meanwhile, \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2  chairperson \uc2 Jerome Powell\uc2  implied that the federal funds rate (FFR) would rise at a slower pace than the previous month, which signaled lower pressure on the rupiah.\par \par \uc2 "Higher \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  for longer [in the US and Europe]," BI Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 In BI's baseline scenario, the FFR would reach its peak at 5 percent in the first quarter of 2023 and would remain in that position until it dropped to 4.75 percent by the end of next year.\par \par \uc2 However, in the upward risk scenario of the \uc2 Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the FFR would peak at around 5.25 to 6 percent, which would drop to 5 percent during the same time frame.\par \par \uc2 "This phenomenon is a signal of a strong dollar," Perry continued.\par \par \uc2 Perry said that although the US Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen to 106 in recent weeks from its peak of 114, its strength might remain robust in accordance with the figures of inflation, FFR and risk of recession in the US.\par \par \uc2 As investors prefer the "cash is king" mantra these days due to high \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Perry explained, a stable pattern of FFR hikes would be the doom of this mantra.\par \par \uc2 He estimated that if the FFR hike peaks in the months between January and March, the first quarter of 2023, it would signal clarity in the Fed's \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which could incentivize investors to put their money in Indonesia and other emerging markets again.\par \par \uc2 As a result, the rupiah is expected to strengthen after the first quarter due to its strong fundamentals, including robust \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, low inflation rates and continuing trade surplus.\par \par \uc2 "\b \highlight22\uc2 Uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  would still be relatively high until Q1/2023 and [would] drop after that," Perry continued.\par \par \uc2 BI \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  head Solikin M. Juhro added that the inflation rate in 2023 was expected to drop within the 2 to 4 percent range.\par \par \uc2 He said that the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 's interest rate needed to be raised higher at the beginning so that inflation would be clamped down before it gets too high.\par \par \uc2 Other than that, the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  has also become involved in a non-rates \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that could slow down inflation.\par \par \uc2 "If you look at countries abroad, where they only have \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  space from a monetary perspective, they only use \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Solikhin said, "The pressure comes from the supply side, [so if] they respond with \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 , inflation will not go down."\par \par \uc2 Concurring with BI's projection, economists agree that the rupiah has a bigger chance to strengthen in the coming period.\par \par \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  economist Faisal Rachman said on Monday that "there still exists" room for further rupiah appreciation starting from the Fed's monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  meeting this December, as during the same period inflation is also seen to slow down in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 As \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is expected to gain into positive territory in 2023, along with the trade balance, due to relatively high commodity prices, the rupiah's fundamental is deemed "enough", when compared with the currencies of the US and Europe as both regions are expected to enter a recession.\par \par \uc2 "Domestic inflation will be around 5.4 to 5.6 percent at the end of the year--lower than the initial estimate of 6 percent," Faisal toldTheJakartaPost, adding: "In 2023, [inflation] is estimated to hit 3.6 to 4 percent."\par \par \uc2 Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) economist David Sumual also expected the rupiah to get stronger as the dollar became weaker, due to the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (\uc2 PMI\uc2 ) contraction and lower inflation in the US.\par \par \uc2 He expected the Fed to raise the FFR by 50 basis points in December due to the shift for a slower pace of hike.\par \par \uc2 Institute for Demographic and Poverty Studies (IDEAS) director Yusuf Wibisono agreed that the "strong dollar" era is expected to end in the coming months, while the rupiah gains its momentum to appreciate.\par \par \uc2 However, he questioned whether the rupiah should have depreciated in the first place as there was a continuing trade balance surplus, which meant that the dollar should have been in ample supply in the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221206eic60000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Local content rules 'a mistake': AmCham\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 632 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Chamber of Commerce\uc2  in Indonesia (AmCham) has called on the government to conduct reforms on issues inhibiting United States investment in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 During the US-Indonesia Investment Summit 2022 in Jakarta, AmCham expressed its concern in an annual report on the "same governance and regulatory issues that have long held the country back", including local content requirements (TKDN) and red tape.\par \par \uc2 AmCham's Investment Report for this year conveys the views of 22 US-linked companies operating in 10 sectors on the "speedbumps and roadblocks" they say make life harder for foreign investors in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Data from the Investment Ministry show thatrealized foreign direct investment (FDI) originating from the US from January through September 2022 increased 62.2 percent year-on-year (yoy) to US$2.12 billion, ranking the US below Singapore, China (mainland), Hong Kong, Japan and Malaysia.\par \par \uc2 "This report, this year, is probably the most upbeat and optimistic report that we've ever written," AmCham Indonesia managing director Lin Neumann told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 One of the main concerns of US businesses is the TKDN \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which is criticized for ballooning production costs and inhibiting business growth rather than supporting the development of local industries.\par \par \uc2 The TKDN, under Presidential Instruction No. 2/2022, requires the central and regional governments to allocate at least 40 percent of their procurement budgets to domestically sourced goods and services, with a priority for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and cooperatives.\par \par \uc2 Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 28/2021, which stipulates details on import and export licensing through the commodity balance system, is also mentioned as supporting the TKDN \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We are not shy about saying that we think that, [in] trying to attract investment, TKDN is a mistake; it's more likely to drive people away than to bring them in," Neumann continued.\par \par \uc2 The AmCham chief noted that Vietnam and Thailand had no such \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian government, he said, used the TKDN for "a kind of forced investment", but the success rate had been suboptimal for building industries.\par \par \uc2 "It works in some cases; you might get a few factories built, but it doesn't [work]," Neumann continued.\par \par \uc2 "It's not transformative. It doesn't transform the way the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  works."\par \par \uc2 US businesses stated in the report that, although the government had enacted significant efforts through the Job Creation Law and the Online Single Submission (OSS) to accelerate business licensing, the implementation was hampered by a lack of coordination between institutions.\par \par \uc2 "There's still a lack of coordination in the ministries, too many ministries operate in separate silos from one another," Neumann added.\par \par \uc2 The Job Creation Law, he said, enabled US companies to inject their capital into new sectors of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , with projects varying from cell tower acquisition to consumer goods and coal gasification in Sumatra, the latter by US-based \uc2 Air Products\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I know a lot of other consumer companies are betting on the market," Neumann said.\par \par \uc2 "If Indonesia continues to just grow the consumer market, it's very healthy for big companies."\par \par \uc2 Speaking after the summit, Deputy Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Rachmat Kaimuddin disagreed with the notion that the TKDN \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  inhibited FDI.\par \par \uc2 He told the Post on Tuesday that such a \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was still "needed to support domestic industries but improvements are possible" to ensure FDI keeps flowing in.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's (Kadin) deputy chairperson for industry, Bobby Gafur Umar, said on Monday that the TKDN \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  mandates "are good" for lower- and middle-income people.\par \par \uc2 He also said import substitution would accelerate during these times of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  over global supply chains.\par \par \uc2 "There should be no more imports; they must use local goods," Bobby told the Post.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221207eic700004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 GOTO Management Talks Why Share Price Plummets Since November\b0\par\par\uc2 380 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 December 2022\par \uc2 Tempo.co\par \uc2 TEMPOE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Hans Patuwo, director of \uc2 PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk\uc2  (IDX: GOTO) said there were at least three factors affecting the company's operating performances and caused GOTO's share price to continue falling since the end of November. The three factors are macroeconomic conditions, capital markets and competition.\par \par \uc2 "For over two years the business world has experienced challenges triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. And now, we are facing geopolitical conditions, \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and a capital market that is affecting customer confidence," Hans said during the company's \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  expose that was held virtually on Thursday, December 8.\par \par \uc2 Amidst today's \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , he admits that GOTO is not immune. However, he said the company will continue to progress and is committed to growing sustainably.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the group president of Goto Gojek Tokopedia \uc2 Patrick Cao\uc2  said that stock price fluctuations are common among \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies as it is part of the market mechanism\u8212\'20\'14influenced by various factors.\par \par \uc2 GoTo held an IPO in April this year and GOTO's lock-up period ended on November 30. Since then, the tech giant's shares have continued to come under pressure, hitting its auto rejection lower limit or \uc2 ARB\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With the end of the lock-up period, Patrick said, the number of GOTO's floating shares increases, causing the trading frequency to rise. "This is caused by several things, including profit taking from first investors who bought at a low price, the end of fund life for financial investors, and the need for liquidity at the end of the year," he said.\par \par \uc2 Patrick said that it is normal for shareowners to seek liquidity after the end of a lock-up, especially if they are the issuer's early-stage investors.\par \par \uc2 "Although we cannot speak on behalf of investors, we generally believe they continue to fundamentally trust GOTO's future business potentials," he remarked.\par \par \uc2 GOTO price on the IDX trade floor continues to plummet. In Thursday's trade, December 8, GOTO closed 6.54 percent down to a new low of Rp100 per share, far below its IPO price of Rp338 per share.\par \par \uc2 Riri Rahayu\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/11/30/id_1161616/1161616_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020221208eic8000gq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

In its World \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Outlook October 2022 report, the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  again lowered its 2023 global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth projection to 2.7 percent, from 2.9 percent in July 2022 and 3.8 percent in January 2022.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 IMF\uc2  also predicted that 31 countries representing 43 percent of the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  would experience an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recession in 2023. Other prominent international institutions such as the \uc2 World Bank\uc2  and \uc2 OECD\uc2  conveyed the same message.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  has been affected through both trade and financial channels. The impact through the trade channel can be seen in massive worker layoffs in textile and footwear companies due to the weakening global demand. Meanwhile, the impact through the financial channel can be seen in the capital outflows as foreign-portfolio investors unloaded their rupiah assets as government bonds.\par \par \uc2 However, Indonesia does not need to worry too much. Commodity and energy prices are likely to remain moderately high, although lower than in 2022 but higher than in 2021, as projected by the \uc2 World Bank\uc2  (2022). Windfall profits will still support state revenue, although not as large as this year. The \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  authority can use the funds to boost \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and to provide social aid funds for people affected by the global recession.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  still benefits slightly from being less intensively connected to the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  as it is not yet fully part of the global value chain. Global production disruptions have had relatively little impact on domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity. Meanwhile, the growth of the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is still mostly driven by domestic consumption. This situation has made Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  relatively resilient to various crises overseas. All these factors will make the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  remain strong next year, even though it will grow slower than in 2022. In short, Indonesia will not experience a recession.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  said at the \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  Annual Meeting (PTBI), held in a hybrid manner on Nov. 30 that Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is still solid, predicted at the range of 4.5-5.3 percent in 2023 and 4.7-5.5 percent in 2024. Likewise, inflation is increasingly under control and predicted to decline and return to the target of 3.0 ? 1 percent in 2023 and 2.5 ? 1 percent in 2024.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the country's external resilience also remains stable. The current account is projected to book a 0.4 percent surplus or 0.4 percent \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, followed by a 0.2 percent surplus--0.6 percent \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2024. Bank-credit disbursement will grow in the range of 10-12 percent in 2023 and 2024. Digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and finance, considered the engine of new \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, will also surge in 2023 and 2024, with the value of e-commerce transactions predicted at between Rp 572 trillion (US$38 billion) and Rp 689 trillion, electronic money between Rp 508 trillion and Rp 640 trillion and digital banking in the range of Rp 67 quadrillion and Rp 87 quadrillion.\par \par \uc2 BI's confidence is linked to its strategy of \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix between monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that focuses on stability (pro-stability) with other policies, namely macroprudential, payment system, financial-market deepening and inclusive- and green-financial \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , that focuses on \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth (pro-growth). This \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix is proven powerful and effective in dealing with various turbulences that have shaken the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , such as the 2008 global financial crisis, the 2013 taper tantrum and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\par \par \uc2 We should remember that the effectiveness of the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  mix is due to BI's close synergy and coordination with various parties at the national and international levels as well. The success in controlling inflationary pressures after the subsidized fuel price increase, beginning on Sept. 3, is the result of BI's close \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  coordination with the central and regional governments and strategic partners through the Central and Regional Inflation Control Teams (TPIP/D), as well as the National Movement for Food Inflation Control (GNPIP) in various regions.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  synergy between BI, the Finance Ministry and the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK) aimed at maintaining macroeconomic and financial-system stability and encouraging lending to the business world. And last but not least, international cooperation with central banks and other partner-country authorities in the financial sector.\par \par \uc2 Despite the optimistic outlook for Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023, the country must remain vigilant against various global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoils, including the risk of stagflation (\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown and high inflation) and reflation (\b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recession and high inflation).\par \par \uc2 We must remember President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2 's message at the BI annual meeting that Indonesia should not be complacent, but must remain cautious and vigilant because global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  persist.\par \par \uc2 __________________\par \par \uc2 A senior analyst at Financial System Surveillance Department, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

\par\par \b \uc2 Second-home visa triggers panic in expat community\b0\par\par\uc2 Deni Ghifari, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 927 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Foreigners who have lived in Indonesia for years or decades are anxious about new visa rules that will kick in later this month, which require retirees to hold substantial funds in the country.\par \par \uc2 The government has issued a circular telling holders of retirement stay permits to convert to the so-called second-home visa, but many in the expat pensioners community say they do not have the assets needed for the new visa type and worry about their future.\par \par \uc2 "Immigration officers are \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  how to interpret the new regulations, which increases the stress on people seeking accurate information," said Russell (not his real name), a 72-year-old Australian retiree living in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara.\par \par \uc2 According to Immigration Directorate General Circular No. IMI-0740.GR.01.01/2022, released on Oct. 25, the new \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  around the second-home visa is to take effect on Dec. 24.\par \par \uc2 The new visa type requires proof of funds amounting to Rp 2 billion (US$128,000) in a personal account in one of Indonesia's state-owned banks or proof of luxury property ownership in the country, neither of which are easy requirements to fulfill for most pensioners.\par \par \uc2 "What's going to happen for me is I've made my life [in Bali], and on Dec. 24, if they announce these are the rules, then I'm just going to euthanize my dogs, and then I'm going [back to Australia] to euthanize myself," recounted a 58-year-old pensioner from the United Kingdom called Charles (not his real name) about the troubling plan of an Australian pensioner he knows.\par \par \uc2 Many of the foreign retirees say they have nothing and no one back in their country of origin and insist that Indonesia is not their second home, but their only home. They lead a life of calm retirement, living on monthly pension payouts with no substantial funds in any bank.\par \par \uc2 Previously, the elderly had two options, namely a temporary stay permit (KITAS) and a permanent stay permit (KITAP), with the former requiring proof of funds amounting to Rp 280 million, which is but a fraction of the Rp 2 billion needed for the second-home visa.\par \par \uc2 According to the circular, KITAP and KITAS which are still valid for more than 180 days from the enactment of the circular will turn invalid, requiring them to change to the second-home visa.\par \par \uc2 "It is upsetting for many that the Indonesian government is preparing to cancel retirement permits that have already been issued prior to their expiry date," said Russell.\par \par \uc2 "The changes are causing unnecessary stress for people who have been living in Indonesia for, in my friend's case, 26 years, and who do not have the funds required to deposit to obtain a second-home permit," he added.\par \par \uc2 Despite the spurring panic, the government has been laying low after releasing the circular. On Tuesday, Immigration Directorate General \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  relations subcoordinator Achmad Nur Saleh told The Jakarta Post to "be patient" and wait for the launch of the new visa on Dec. 21, leaving unanswered widespread questions about details of the implementation.\par \par \uc2 The rationale behind the proof of funds requirement appears to be a government effort to draw more money into the country from pensioners looking to spend their retirement in Indonesia, seemingly with little concern for those already in the country.\par \par \uc2 Not one of the three relevant government institutions--the Immigration Directorate General, the \uc2 Law and Human Rights Ministry\uc2  or the Tourism and Creative \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Ministry--provided any answers to the Post's inquiries.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the KITAP and KITAS, the second-home visa will reportedly allow foreigners to invest in Indonesia, but it remains unclear in what capacity they will be allowed to earn money and how that will be \b \highlight22\uc2 taxed\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "No one anywhere on any of the social media, or my agent, or anyone else's agent, or even the Immigration [office] has any clear information [...]. I haven't heard anybody who can clarify [the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 ]," said 66-year-old Australian retiree Jennifer Beeston.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of what will happen by Dec. 24, Beeston said she has all the intention to stay. With the second-home visa in place, Beeston would be left with no choice but to stay in Indonesia on a tourist visa, which she would need to renew every two months at a cost of Rp 3 million.\par \par \uc2 "I won't leave; I love Indonesia; I love Bali. [...] I want to live peacefully here. I'm not a tourist, I don't act like a tourist. This is my life here," said Beeston, emphasizing that it was a big decision to move to another country.\par \par \uc2 Beeston said she understood what the Indonesian government was trying to achieve with the second-home visa, but added: "I think they're sacrificing an important demographic," referring to many pensioners who are planning to leave the country for a more pensioner-friendly destination, such as Thailand, Vietnam or the Philippines.\par \par \uc2 The figure of foreign pensioners in Indonesia is hard to ascertain, but one \uc2 Facebook\uc2  group called Bali Retirement Group alone has 2,800 members.\par \par \uc2 A 72-year-old retiree from the United States wishing to be referred to only by her initial "D" recounted how she went for a short trip to Bali on a whim in 1990 after going through breast cancer and nearly dying from a complication.\par \par \uc2 "I'd been eliminated from my very good corporate job. I was spiritually lost, destroyed, decimated," said D.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221211eicb0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Future readiness: Here's why the success of smaller businesses matters\b0\par\par\uc2 1,152 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Olivier M. Schwab and Olivier Woeffray,\par \par \uc2 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-sized companies are the backbone of many countries' economies, so we must work together to ensure their success and their impact on some of the world's biggest and most pressing issues.\par \par \uc2 Smaller companies represent 90 percent of all companies and are responsible for nearly 70 percent of both jobs and gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide.\par \par \uc2 Taking a closer look at these companies, it is therefore perhaps unsurprising that the \uc2 World \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Forum\uc2 's Future Readiness of SMEs and Mid-Sized Companies: A Year On report finds that smaller businesses have what it takes to enable widespread growth, innovation and sustainability in our global, regional and local economies. Now is the time to harness this potential.\par \par \uc2 SMEs at the frontline of global turbulences\par \par \uc2 The post-COVID era is significantly more challenging than most people had initially hoped. Heightened geopolitical tensions, the energy crisis, supply chain disruptions, hyperinflation and extreme weather events are just a few of the difficulties that will make the coming decade a demanding one.\par \par \uc2 SMEs and mid-sized companies are often at the frontline of such turbulence. Indeed, some estimates of small business closures as a result of COVID-19 are as high as a third closing down permanently due to the shock of the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 This leads many of those that remain to be absorbed by a focus on survival and growth, which in turn often prevents them looking at other elements that are essential for them to thrive in the long term.\par \par \uc2 According to the report, the top challenge currently preoccupying 67 percent of executives of SMEs and mid-sized companies is survival and expansion and almost half of them highlight talent as one of their main challenges. By comparison, just 25 percent say that one of their main areas of focus is technology and innovation and only 7 percent highlight sustainability as a key challenge.\par \par \uc2 So the question we must ask is this: How can smaller companies not only ensure their immediate survival. but are also in a position to leverage their unique abilities to ensure their long-term success and future readiness?\par \par \uc2 Being future ready includes three different core capabilities:\par \par \uc2 First, long-term growth: Ability to generate lasting financial strength driven by innovative business models, products and/or services.\par \par \uc2 Second, societal impact: Ability to not only address both positive and negative potential externalities but, most importantly, that any business outcomes affect society positively and in line with environmental, social and governance goals.\par \par \uc2 Third, adaptive capacity: Ability to develop high levels of resilience and agility, enabling the company to bounce back in difficult times and to identify and seize opportunities as they emerge, and to create disruption in business models of the future.\par \par \uc2 This will not only enable them to thrive but also to successfully shape the nature of growth, innovation and sustainability of our global, regional and local economies.\par \par \uc2 To ensure impact, future readiness capability building should not be developed as ad hoc initiatives, but instead be embedded into key corporate strategies and decision-making processes--ideally from the very start so that it becomes part of the fundamental building blocks of the company itself.\par \par \uc2 Given the current context, we found that a focus on adaptive capacity--resilience and agility--can be of particular relevance for a step change in the future readiness of smaller companies, particularly in volatile and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  environments.\par \par \uc2 Research has shown that SMEs and mid-sized companies tend to be less resilient than their larger counterparts, but they in turn display much higher levels of agility.\par \par \uc2 Working on resilience can help a business move out an overwhelming focus on the short term and overwhelming focus on survival, while making the most of their high level of agility--one of smaller companies' most important competitive advantage.\par \par \uc2 To boost resilience, SMEs and mid-sized companies can learn from the below depending on their level of maturity:\par \par \uc2 * Emergence: Authentic leaders positively and strongly impact the future readiness of their companies. They lead with a vision and values, self-awareness, self-\b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , positive modelling and encouraging authenticity. They tend to empower employees, which subsequently motivates the latter to increase their efforts towards fulfilling the organizational mission.\par \par \uc2 * Development: Talent fit is to be understood as a major driver of resilience for smaller companies. In this context, the "right" people believe in the company's purpose, work collaboratively with others and have complementary qualities like resourcefulness and passion in fulfilling their roles. Smaller companies can appeal to values and provide an environment aligned with these values.\par \par \uc2 * Consolidation: While leaders and talent fit significantly impact the resilience and future readiness of smaller companies, more mature companies need to focus on developing business frameworks such as orientation, business model flexibility, networks, digital infrastructure and governance. Using governance as an explicit business strategy is key, particularly as it is generally new territory for small companies. In addition, we have identified three opportunity areas where smaller businesses can leverage their high levels of agility.\par \par \uc2 * Digital: Smaller companies can take advantage of their quicker communication channels and close relationships to initiate and execute digital transformation at a faster rate than larger corporations, which often struggle to overcome inertia and motivate employees for change.\par \par \uc2 * Sustainability: Conduct a systematic and holistic business life cycle analysis, then leverage this data to inform the strategizing and prioritizing of low-carbon initiatives and build connect actions to the level of maturity of the organization in the sustainability space.\par \par \uc2 * Talent: Prioritize and communicate organizational culture and values, using informal HR practices to the company's advantage, plus prioritize employee-organization match as much as (or more than) skills and experience.\par \par \uc2 While SMEs and mid-sized companies can do a lot of the work needed themselves, there is also a need for the wider ecosystem and \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  environment to support them.\par \par \uc2 This was highlighted as one of the major challenges for these companies, with 24 percent and 25 percent of them ranking funding and access to capital as well as \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  environment respectively.\par \par \uc2 One particular area in which this can be done is through digital trade and the implementation of targeted measures aimed at harmonizing and driving interoperability of trade data across borders and supply chains to help small companies trade internationally.\par \par \uc2 It is also important to recognize the impact the wider \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  environment has on their ability to thrive. Policymakers, investors and other stakeholders must ensure they do what is in their capacity to contribute to building the future readiness of this segment of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SMEs and mid-sized companies have a unique ability and strengths to pivot their business models to be future ready. We must help them reach their full potential.\par \par \uc2 __________________\par \par \uc2 Olivier M.

The \uc2 UN\uc2  will continue to support the Indonesian government in adapting innovative methods and ensuring that these methods are put to good use for the country and its people,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 The sector is one that is vital as it provides employment to 97 percent of Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s total workforce or around 117 million workers, 64.5 percent of whom are women.\par \par \uc2 A number of questions were addressed in the report, including determining key emerging issues for the sectors and what could potentially alter and disrupt the future of MSMEs.\par \par \uc2 Five were then identified, including climate change, increasing sustainable \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  partnerships, the rise of emerging sectors, and changes in consumer preferences.\par \par \uc2 (T.A085/A/Y012/Y012) 16-12-2022 00:58:18\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221215eicg001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 RI's restrictive trade hurts manufacturing: \uc2 World Bank\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 842 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 World Bank\uc2  has criticized Indonesia's trade policies for their restrictions on imports, as studies show that such measures are counterproductive to achieving value-added manufacturing development.\par \par \uc2 During the launch of theIndonesia \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Prospects (IEP) 2022December edition on Thursday, the Bretton Woods institution explained that non-\b \highlight22\uc2 tariff\b0 \highlight\uc2  measures (NTMs), services-trade restrictions and trade-facilitation issues needed to be addressed in order to accelerate manufacturing growth.\par \par \uc2 World Bank\uc2  research showed that Indonesia's trade volume in goods and services over the past 40 years was half the global average, but only a third of the growth in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.\par \par \uc2 Deindustrialization that happened after the Asian Financial Crisis, meanwhile, had shrunk the country's value-added exports from 31 percent of total gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002 to just 19 percent in 2021.\par \par \uc2 "Indonesia's trade potential has been slightly lagging behind the unprecedented growth of world trade over the past four decades," \uc2 World Bank\uc2  senior economist Csilla Lakatos said.\par \par \uc2 The institution's officials explained that, although the reduction of Indonesia's import tariffs had been "significant", the use of NTMs had risen during the same period.\par \par \uc2 Such measures equaled 30 percent of tariffs, she said, and 30 percent of these NTMs were 15 times the level of tariffs in the country.\par \par \uc2 As such, the \uc2 World Bank\uc2  mentioned that NTMs affected the import of capital goods and machinery that were essential to gross fixed capital formation for domestic industry. The bank pointed out that nearly two-thirds of Indonesian exports were conducted by firms that were both importers and exporters.\par \par \uc2 These firms, Lakatos said, were much more productive, had higher export frequency and more diversified destinations than firms that only sourced their materials from the domestic market.\par \par \uc2 "Achieving the government's 35 percent import substitution objectives would come with significant disruptions," Lakatos continued.\par \par \uc2 Unnecessary barriers\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 World Bank\uc2 's report also recommended that Indonesia remove "unnecessary" NTMs in the form of import approvals, mandatory certification with national standards, port of entry restrictions and local content requirements.\par \par \uc2 If such a \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was to be implemented, Lakatos estimated Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth could increase by 5 percentage points (ppt), 10 ppt growth in exports and 27 ppt growth in investment.\par \par \uc2 Restrictions on services inhibited the growth of foreign direct investment (FDI), the economist continued, as FDI had been the main mode of delivery aside from establishing foreign affiliates.\par \par \uc2 Entry for foreign professionals and barriers to competition were also among the majority of restrictions that hampered manufacturing, the report stated.\par \par \uc2 Deepening trade agreements that went beyond market access issues were also imperative to global value chain (GVC) diversification, which included deals on competition \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , intellectual property \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , environmental protection and labor rights.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, deepening trade agreements could also act as an "insurance \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 " for Indonesia against the potential perception of protectionism by trading partners.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the same event, World \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Timor Leste country director Satu Kahkonen said that more foreign firms would come to Indonesia if the country opened up its trade policies, and such a decision would not harm Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 A closed trade system increases the cost of production, she said, so more investors equals more ideas, products and technologies in the domestic market, which increases domestic firms' access to new technologies and reduced costs.\par \par \uc2 "You would see the cost of trade declining, and that would immediately benefit Indonesian consumers," Kahkonen told reporters.\par \par \uc2 Trade Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency head Kasan Muhri said on Thursday that he did not agree with all of the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 's recommendations, but he conceded the idea of diversifying exports and increasing the trade contribution to GDP.\par \par \uc2 He said that NTMs were not always bad, as long as they did not turn into a trade barrier, as imports were essential for manufacturing growth. Unnecessary NTMs, he said, had been largely removed by the omnibus Job Creation Law.\par \par \uc2 "\b \highlight22\uc2 Uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  should be removed for importation procedures," Kasan told forum participants.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia Employers Association (Apindo) manufacturing industry head Johnny Darmawan said on Thursday that although he agreed that the local component \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  increased costs for manufacturers, it was needed to ensure that Indonesia would not be a mere market for foreign products.\par \par \uc2 As a result, he recommended that the government should have a clear goal of what to be expected by the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , such as supporting developing domestic industries' technology for a certain period of time that could increase their global competitiveness.\par \par \uc2 "I think we have to review again the NTMs," Johnny said.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia\uc2  (ERIA) lead advisor Lili Yan Ing added that reforming NTMs should be done carefully to separate those that were really creating trade barriers.\par \par \uc2 The former Trade Ministry special staff advocated improving Indonesian human capital as a way to increase value-added industries, instead of enforcing the purchase of domestically produced goods.\par \par \uc2 "We need to review, make it transparent, make it less costly, or even free, to obtain permits and licenses," Lili said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221216eicg00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Year of turmoil to test  \highlight22\uc2 fiscal \highlight\uc2  consolidation\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 1,117 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Despite facing many possible setbacks throughout 2022, Indonesia is still poised to accomplish its \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2 -consolidation plan in time, giving the country a better foothold to withstand whatever looming global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  will throw at it next year.\par \par \uc2 In 2023, the annual-\b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  must return to below 3 percent after being allowed to exceed the limit for the past three years, with 2022 the last year to do so as mandated by 2020 COVID-19 response law.\par \par \uc2 So far, the government has made sure the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation progressed smoothly with this year's \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  projected to be around 3.92 percent of GDP or smaller, making it much lower than 2020 and 2021, when the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  hovered at 6.09 and 4.65 percent of GDP respectively, according to the Finance Ministry.\par \par \uc2 "Our outlook: in 2022, the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  will be much better than the projected 3.92 percent. It is possible that we can see the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  go below 3 percent," Febrio Kacaribu, the ministry's head of \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  agency told reporters on Dec. 1 in the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2 , adding the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  had only amounted to 0.91 percent as of October.\par \par \uc2 The ministry attributed the progress due to greater-than-expected \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue and a revenue windfall from high-commodity prices, which -- aside from lowering the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  -- helped the government to slash debt issuance by half the amount initially planned.\par \par \uc2 The progress was once threatened by swelling fuel \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and "compensation" -- payables to state-owned energy firms -- to keep energy prices cheap amid high oil price and depreciated rupiah, albeit tripling the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  to Rp 502 trillion (US$32.14 billion). However, a decision was made to hike subsidized-fuel prices by 30 percent to avoid more damage to \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation.\par \par \uc2 The government has set next year's \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  to hover around 2.84 percent, not far from this year's latest projection that might hit below 3 percent sooner than expected.\par \par \uc2 Finance Minister \uc2 Sri Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  explained that having \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  discipline would allow Indonesia to hold fast against financial-market turbulence, depreciated rupiah and high-\b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  induced by tighter-monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which would all make borrowing more costly, to finance the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "If you don't have \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  discipline, which could act as an anchor [to maintain stability], then what may happen is that confidence [in the government] may fall apart," Sri Mulyani told audiences on Dec. 2 during an event held in Presidential Palace, citing the example of British \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In response, the ministry plans to bank on unused 2022 \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  to finance the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  next year and stresses that it will not lead to a \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  cut.\par \par \uc2 Weaker revenue\par \par \uc2 Anushka Shah, vice president and senior analyst of sovereign-risk group \uc2 Moody's\uc2  Investors Service, said on Dec. 7 that next year would be challenging for Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  consolidation.\par \par \uc2 She said commodity price is projected to moderate, partly triggered by monetary tightening in many countries, posing a headwind for next-year's growth that will also affect revenue collection needed to maintain \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She projected Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth to slow to around 4.8 percent of GDP next year, much lower than the government's target of 5.3 percent of GDP. Similarly, the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 , \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  (\uc2 IMF\uc2 ) and \uc2 Asian Development Bank\uc2  (ADB) have estimated lower growth for Indonesia at around just 5 percent.\par \par \uc2 Consequently, Indonesian debt affordability -- a measure that assesses how much debt a country could afford -- is expected to worsen in 2023 due to lack of increase in revenue, whereas interest payments will remain high because of the higher cost of borrowing.\par \par \uc2 "We do think that a higher rate and weaker \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth will have an impact on \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  metrics," Shah said.\par \par \uc2 According to Finance Ministry data, interest payments next year hover at around Rp 441 trillion, a twofold increase from the beginning of President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2 's term and comprising roughly a fifth of central-government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Radhika Rao\uc2 , senior economist at Singapore-based lender DBS, wrote in a report on Nov. 9 that Indonesia's low \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue-to-GDP ratio has been flagged as a long-standing constraint, which she hoped could be relieved by several measures to increase \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue given the added burden from extended fuel \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to next year's \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 According to Finance Ministry data, the Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2 -to-GDP ratio has been standing at around 10 percent or less for the last five years, below the 15-percent threshold required by \uc2 IMF\uc2  to stimulate the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and also the lowest among peers.\par \par \uc2 Despite all the challenges from weaker-revenue side, both Rao and Shah believed Indonesia would still be able to close the gap to their pre-pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  positions in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Financing challenges\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 Moody's\uc2  Shah expected Indonesia's debt financing to be more reliant on domestic borrowing with homegrown banks and local institutions to absorb most of its issuance, whereas shares among foreign-bond holders would continue declining given a possibly prolonged high Fed fund rate.\par \par \uc2 With the decline in foreign holders, Indonesian banks have accumulated 29.5 percent of the government's local-currency bonds, followed by the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 , at 20.9 percent as of the first half of 2022, whereas in the first quarter of 2020, they were only 26.9 percent and 9 percent respectively, ADB data showed.\par \par \uc2 Abdul Manap, researcher at Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef), stated on Dec. 7 that an increased role in banks to finance the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  could negatively impact the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , arguing it could resort to making less money available for borrowers, as banks sought to disburse their money to government bonds instead.\par \par \uc2 He also expected the high interest rate on loans likely to persist in 2023, as they would need to compete with yields offered from government bonds, further slowing the transmission of \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2 's (BI) \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  rate amid a lower benchmark rate.\par \par \uc2 As banks' role to finance \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  increase, sluggish loan disbursement was also shown by the drop in loan-to-GDP ratio that stood at 60 percent as of August this year, much lower than 68.6 percent back in 2018, \uc2 Financial Services Authority (OJK) \uc2 data revealed.\par \par \uc2 "We can expect loan disbursement to slow down, therefore our \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth will be stagnant," Abdul said.\par \par \uc2 Abdul also hoped that the government would think twice before reactivating another burden-sharing scheme beyond 2022, which is made possible by the financial omnibus law, arguing BI's role in financing the \b \highlight22\uc2 deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  might carry risk to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  itself.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221218eici00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

This trust must be maintained with professionalism within the TNI that must be continuously improved," Jokowi stated after the inauguration of Admiral Yudo Margono as TNI commander at the State Palace, here, Monday.\par \par \uc2 He also reminded Margono to continue to maintain the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of the Republic of Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in response to the political year leading up to the 2024 election, Jokowi urged Margono to ensure that the TNI would remain neutral. The TNI should also maintain synergy with the National Police to keep the national situation conducive.\par \par \uc2 "(It is) because political stability and security stability are important in the framework of the country"s development. Our \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development is also in an \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  situation due to global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Jokowi noted.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Margono said the directives given by President Jokowi had become his priority as TNI commander.\par \par \uc2 "The first task is to protect sovereignty, to maintain unity, and then to protect and defend the TNI that has become the people"s trust. Those are my priorities," he stated.\par \par \uc2 Margono said he would hold a meeting with former TNI Commander General \uc2 Andika Perkasa\uc2  in order to formulate policies that aligned the closest with the priorities as TNI commander.\par \par \uc2 "I will conduct entry briefing first. I will then gather the staff and chief of staff to formulate it.

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The world will be concomitantly confronted with the rise in inflation rate and risk of recession in 2023, Chairman of the Financial Services Authority"s (OJK"s) Board of Commissioners Mahendra Siregar stated.\par \par \uc2 In handling these issues, the government either has to raise the interest rate to reduce inflation or reduce the interest rate to stimulate the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , thereby preventing recession, he remarked.\par \par \uc2 The monetary authority cannot handle these challenges at the same time, given that its main duty is to only control the inflation rate and not to mitigate the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  decline, he explained during the Consumer Protection Dissemination and Education webinar, Monday.\par \par \uc2 "The impact on \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth is outside of its (scope of) competence, that is not where the duty of BI (\b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2 ) or other central banks in the world lies, but in mitigating price stability," he elaborated.\par \par \uc2 Despite this, if the price is rising high, and it is coupled with the declining \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , then the government has to intervene in handling this by encouraging growth, he noted.\par \par \uc2 "Next year, these challenges will happen simultaneously. High inflation, severe recession. If we want to raise the interest rate, then recession happens. If we do not raise the interest rate, then inflation continues to rise," Siregar noted.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, analysts estimated that the geopolitical conflict in 2023 will not be resolved within the next decade that will certainly affect the supply chain and logistics at the global level, he added.\par \par \uc2 However, analysts and multilateral institutions have also forecast that the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Indonesia and Southeast Asia will continue to grow positively at around five percent year-on-year (yoy) in 2023.\par \par \uc2 "How can this happen? The answer is because we have a large domestic market and regional market. This domestic market should be optimized in terms of consumption, investment, and government \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Siregar stressed.\par \par \uc2 On the occasion, he also said that Indonesia should stimulate new growth sources in regions as a foundation to handle global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the years to come.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-FLI/A/H-FDH/H-FDH) 19-12-2022 18:14:17\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221219eicj0018h\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Yudo Margono Inaugurated as Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s New Military Commander\b0\par\par\uc2 437 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Globe\par \uc2 JGLOBE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022.

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Azis Kurmala\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Indonesian government will help with the cost of shipping eggs from Java Island to control their price, which has increased of late, Minister of Trade, Zulkifli Hasan, has assured.\par \par \uc2 Based on data from the Ministry of Trade"s Market Monitoring System and Basic Needs (SP2KP), the national average price of purebred chicken eggs has been recorded at Rp31,500 per kilogram, an increase from the normal price range of around Rp27 thousand to Rp29 thousand.\par \par \uc2 "We and the Minister of Home Affairs and others have a meeting with the regional government, if (the price increase) is more than 5 percent, we will assist with transportation costs so that the price does not exceed Rp31 thousand to Rp32 thousand," Hasan said at the Jakarta Presidential Palace on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Chicken eggs are one of the commodities that will need to be watched at the end of this year due to increased demand, he added.\par \par \uc2 According to the minister, the high demand for eggs has been triggered by many traders and the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  making cakes ahead of Christmas.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, the government has committed to bearing the transportation costs for shipping eggs from Java. "Taking it from Java to Kalimantan (the government) will bear the transportation costs," the Trade Minister said.\par \par \uc2 Based on a report from Statistics Indonesia (BPS), inflation in November 2022 reached 0.09 percent compared to the previous month (month-to-month/mtm).\par \par \uc2 The increase in the price of eggs for purebred chickens contributed 0.02 percent to inflation.\par \par \uc2 The price of purebred chicken eggs had the highest contribution to November 2022 inflation on a monthly basis due to increased demand. The price of purebred chicken eggs rose by 2.77 percent (mtm) and 17.11 percent (yoy) to an average of Rp27,476 per kilogram.\par \par \uc2 President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) earlier called on governors, district heads, and mayors to pay attention to inflation movements from hour to hour, as the consumer price index is the \u8220\'20\'1Cscourge of all countries.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 "I ask you to pay attention from time to time, from hour to hour, the movement of the inflation rate in each region. This is very important,\u8221\'20\'1D he stressed.\par \par \uc2 The threat of rising inflation would be one of the challenges for the domestic and global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  next year, he said. Hence, regional heads have been urged to work hard to control the supply and stock of goods and services in their respective regions.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is the scourge of all countries. Inflation. Once again, pay attention to the movement of the inflation rate in each region," he said.\par \par \uc2 In addition to regional heads, Widodo urged ministries and non-ministerial institutions (K/L) to accelerate the realization of \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially capital and social \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the 2023 State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I ask to speed up the realization of \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he said.\par \par \uc2 The head of state called upon all ministries and institutions as well as regional governments to be sensitive to crises and to always be alert against global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He stressed that central and regional government officials must understand that currently, the world is facing unfavorable conditions.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEveryone must be really prepared for all the various possibilities that might occur, which we did not predict, which we did not calculate. (This is so that we are) not only able to survive but also able to take advantage of every opportunity that exists,\u8220\'20\'1C he stated.\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/R013/R013) 19-12-2022 20:44:44\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221220eicj002xr\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Raw Sugar Scarcity\b0\par\par\uc2 2,307 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 December 2022\par \uc2 Tempo Magazine\par \uc2 TEMGEN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk. \par \par \uc2 DWIATMOKO Setiono can consider himself lucky. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Sekawan Karsa Mulia still has some remaining refined sugar stock from contracts with producers, enough to last until February next year. Sekawan Karsa Mulia, which produces chocolate drinks, jams and puddings, has ordered refined sugar or sugar specifically for industry from Angel Products factory since September.\par \par \uc2 When the contract was signed, Dwiatmoko said, the sugar he ordered was allocated for production until the end of this month. But there has been a shift in production plan, leaving behind leftovers. \u8220\'20\'1CThe rest can still be used until February,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Tempo on December 16. Sekawan Karsa Mulia signed a purchase contract for 600 tons of refined sugar that can be shipped until next February. According to Dwi\u8217\'20\'19s calculations, there is around 200 tons of stock remaining that the company can use until early 2023. \u8220\'20\'1CSo far, we are safe.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Dwiatmoko and Sekawan Karsa Mulia can relax because they have secured sugar stock, unlike other food and beverage producers who are worried as theirs continue to run out whilst there is no new supply. Dwiatmoko said that his colleagues at the Refined Sugar Industry Users Forum are scrambling as they are completely out of stock. He said that for the F&B industry\u8212\'20\'14especially chocolate factories\u8212\'20\'14sugar can make up to 50 percent of their entire raw ingredients.\par \par \uc2 As chair of the forum, Dwiatmoko contacted several sugar factories. However, he said, none have been willing to make contracts as they are also low on stock.\par \par \uc2 The same concern is spreading among members of the Soft Drink Industry Association (Asrim). Asrim General Chair Triyono Pridjosoesilo confirmed that members were dealing with a stock crisis of refined sugar. The cause, he said, is that the import permit for raw sugar to be processed into refined crystal sugar has not been issued. \u8220\'20\'1CMany are concerned that if there are no solutions the industry will be forced to stop producing as there is no raw ingredient to process,\u8221\'20\'1D he said on Tuesday, December 13.\par \par \uc2 Sacks of refined sugar or white refined sugar from India at \uc2 Tanjung Priok Port\uc2 , Jakarta, April 6, 2021. Tempo/Tony Hartawan/photo file\par \par \uc2 Triyono said the beverage industry players first heard that the raw sugar import permit had not been completed in October. But back then, they still believed that with time, the bureaucratic affairs would soon be sorted out. Moreover, he said, industry players usually prepare stocks to meet the increased consumption needs during Christmas and New Year celebrations.\par \par \uc2 No one expected that the permit issue would remain unresolved until this month, just weeks ahead of the New Year. In the last three weeks, he said, complaints from factory owners about depleting sugar stocks had gotten louder. On the other hand, refined sugar producers are unable to make new contracts to add supply, because they do not have the permit to import raw sugar.\par \par \uc2 Triyono started to move. Asrim sent two letters on December 8, one for Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan and another to Industry Minister \uc2 Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita\uc2 . The next day, he sent another letter to Coordinating Minister for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Airlangga Hartarto.\par \par \uc2 In the letter, Asrim spoke about beverage industry players\u8217\'20\'19 concerns that they might have to stop production at the end of December because they run out of refined sugar. This is happening amid the industry\u8217\'20\'19s path towards recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic as well as global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Refined crystal sugar at a sugar factory in Cilegon, Banten, April 2020. Kemendag.go.id\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis will certainly have an impact on goods availability. Also in terms of employment in Asrim members\u8217\'20\'19 industrial production facilities,\u8221\'20\'1D the letter stated, signed by Triyono and Asrim Secretary-General Tri Junanto. \u8220\'20\'1CWe always communicate with the ministry, where is the process? We are informing them about the situation via telephone and correspondence,\u8221\'20\'1D said Triyono.\par \par \uc2 The declining stock of industrial sugar is also experienced by large-scale food and beverage producers, such as Garudafood. As quoted from Antara, Head of Corporate Communications and Relations of \uc2 Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya\uc2  (GOOD) Dian Astriana said that refined crystal sugar is one of the main raw materials that must be fulfilled in the manufacturing of the majority of its products. \u8220\'20\'1CIf the supply of refined crystal sugar experiences problems, it will definitely have the potential to affect our production,\u8221\'20\'1D she said on Monday, December 5.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian Refined Sugar Association (AGRI) predicted that there would be around 30,000 tons left of national refined crystal sugar stocks until the end of December. This is far below the average industry demand, which is between 250,000 and 280,000 tons. During special seasons like end of fasting month celebration Idul Fitri, the need for industrial sugar could surge up to 300,000 tons. AGRI Executive Director Gloria Guida Manalu said that currently some of the factories have stopped operating because there is no more raw sugar to process.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 A LIMITED coordination meeting was finally held at the office of the coordinating ministry for the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Central Jakarta on Friday, December 9. Refined sugar producers and owners of F&B factories had been waiting to have a discussion about national food stocks. Industry players hoped that the ministers who attended the meeting would soon decide about the procurement allocation of raw sugar for 2023, which will be processed into refined sugar.\par \par \uc2 The Coordinating Ministry for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Secretary Susiwijono Moegiarso said that based on the regulations, limited coordination meetings are only held in the first week or at the beginning of each month. The problem, he said, was that the first week of December only lasted until the second. \u8220\'20\'1CSo the meeting could only be held on December 9, because it still counts as the first week,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Tempo on Wednesday, December 14.\par \par \uc2 Coordinating Minister for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2  chaired the meeting that was also attended by Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan, Industry Minister \uc2 Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita\uc2 , Agriculture Minister Syahrul Yasin Limpo, of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono, and Chairman of the National Food Agency Arief Prasetyo Adi.\par \par \uc2 According to Susiwijono, this meeting discussed the balances of various types of food, from rice, sugar, salt, meat, corn, to sugar and salt for industries. He said that industrial needs were taken care of by the industry ministry, while food for household consumption goods is handled by several ministers. The agriculture ministry deals with rice and sugar, while the \uc2 maritime affairs and fisheries ministry\uc2  deals with salt matters.\par \par \uc2 The ministers who attended the meeting agreed on the 2023 National Food Balance, which refers to commodity data from each ministry/agency. However, according to Susiwijono, meeting participants did not specifically discuss refined sugar. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was no special discussion about that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Director-General of Agro Industry at the Industry Ministry Putu Juli Ardika did not respond to Tempo\u8217\'20\'19s questions about the results of the meeting. However, Executive Director of the Indonesian Refined Sugar Association, Gloria Guida Manalu, said that she received information about the allocation of raw sugar imports for the industry. Without mentioning the quota, she said there was a 4-percent increase compared to this year. \u8220\'20\'1CThere is also no quota for each company,\u8221\'20\'1D she added.\par \par \uc2 Previously, Putu said that the import quota for refined crystal sugar raw materials for next year would rise moderately below 5 percent. When compared to this year\u8217\'20\'19s 3.27 million tons, there is a possibility that the total raw material import quota for refined sugar in 2023 will reach 3.4 million tons. \u8220\'20\'1CThere is an increase of less than 5 percent,\u8221\'20\'1D he said after attending a work meeting with the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 (DPR) Commission VII on Wednesday, December 7. The industry ministry is targeting to issue an approval for the imports of refined crystal sugar raw materials in early 2023.\par \par \uc2 According to data from the industry ministry, the demand for sugar in 2022 reached 6.48 million tons, comprising 3.21 million tons of white crystal sugar and 3.27 million tons of refined sugar. Based on the results of the limited coordination meeting on October 26, 2021, the ministers agreed that the raw sugar imports allocation for refined sugar and for consumption in 2022 was 4.37 million tons.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, AGRI wants import permits to be issued sooner. \u8220\'20\'1CHopefully not later than the end of this month,\u8221\'20\'1D said Gloria. She added that the opportunity to get raw sugar supplies is perhaps only from Brazil. Three other countries that usually sell raw sugar to Indonesia, namely Thailand, India and Australia, are holding back their stocks for domestic needs. Thailand, for example, has yet to have a major harvest, so it does not have a surplus of supply to export.\par \par \uc2 The world raw sugar market is currently in a pinch. Reuters reported on December 15 that declining supply from India had raised the price of raw sugar for delivery next year. The government of India, the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest sugar producer, has diverted some of its sugarcane output to produce bioethanol. Even the industry in India is forced to import raw sugar from Brazil, which means the world now also relies on the latter.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, Gloria said, there is information circulating about projections that prices will increase. A certainty in licensing is also needed so that businesses will have time to plan and strategize. \u8220\'20\'1CFor example, which country do you want to buy from and at what price, to make it more competitive,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 Industry players also hope that bureaucracy can run more quickly. This is because, Gloria said, stock scarcity occurs almost at the end of every year. The government implemented a new \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the food sector by making a commodity balance in 2021. This year, it is the second time that a food balance was created. In preparing the balance sheet, she said, all business actors were asked to submit plans for industrial needs within a predetermined time frame. Based on the balance, the government determines stock availability and import needs.\par \par \uc2 However, instead of issuing import permits, the industry ministry issued an order to evaluate raw sugar and refined crystal sugar stocks in factories and warehouses. The ministry will also check the realization of imports, production and distribution. The audit will be carried out on December 15-21 by visiting every refined sugar factory.\par \par \uc2 Adhi S. Lukman, General Chair of the Indonesian Food and Beverage Producers Association (Gapmmi), said that the industry ministry was verifying stocks of industrial sugar using the Ease of Import for Export Destinations (KITE) facility. \u8220\'20\'1CTo find out how much stocks are not exported yet,\u8221\'20\'1D he said on Saturday, December 17.\par \par \uc2 KITE is a special facility given to F&B producers that export their products. This means that processed refined sugar from raw sugar imported with the KITE facility is forbidden from being sold in the domestic market, but must be exported.\par \par \uc2 Gapmmi had proposed an option to the government to divert the remaining industrial sugar stocks that had not been exported to meet domestic needs. This was proposed as an alternative solution to overcome the current shortage of industrial sugar. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are stocks for export. Can this be borrowed to be used locally?\u8221\'20\'1D asked Adhi. According to him, this is the most feasible option because relying only on imports will take a long time. Imported goods are only expected to arrive at the end of January or early February 2023.\par \par \uc2 In June, the trade ministry issued an approval for the import of raw sugar in the form of KITE to four AGRI members, with a total volume of 268,333 tons. Thus, the entire quota of raw sugar import that has been approved by the government for refined sugar factories exceeds 3.68 million tons. This is because the government had previously issued the import approval for 3.4 million tons to meet the domestic demand for refined sugar throughout 2022.\par \par \uc2 Gloria admitted she knew about the evaluation or audit plan. She claimed such verification is normal. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are also facing an audit when planning the industrial needs by Surveyor Indonesia,\u8221\'20\'1D she revealed. Gloria ensured that AGRI members had finished calculating plans for industrial needs and submitted them to the government last September. \u8220\'20\'1CAccording to the schedule set by the government.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 AGRI Deputy Chair Supriadi understands the government\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  of making a food balance, including sugar, as a form of caution. The former director of food, seafood and fisheries industry at the industry ministry said that refined crystal sugar must be limited, so that it does not leak and seep into the retail market, where it is sold like white crystal sugar. \u8220\'20\'1CBecause that would affect the price of sugar, the income of sugarcane farmers, and other things.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Supriadi said that concerns have arisen from different conditions, for example reduced global supplies. As an example, he mentioned that in previous years, producers were able to import raw sugar from Thailand because the distance was closer and the delivery time was shorter. But now, when supply from Thailand is decreasing, refined sugar producers have to buy raw sugar from Brazil, which requires more than one month or around 40 days of shipment.\par \par \uc2 Triyono Pridjosoesilo and members of the Soft Drink Industry Association are concerned about the long time it takes for the imports to arrive. If refined sugar will only be available domestically by February 2023, Triyono said, the beverage industry would face difficulties. \u8220\'20\'1CSugar stocks are running low. Some producers only have stocks that would last until January,\u8221\'20\'1D he explained. He estimated that there will be a period when some business actors will not have refined sugar as a raw material. \u8220\'20\'1CHow can the factories operate?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/12/19/819186/819186_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/12/19/819187/819187_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/12/19/819188/819188_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2022/12/19/819225/819225_1200.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMGEN0020221219eicj0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 The economics of stunting: Provide food not brochures\b0\par\par\uc2 1,232 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Gilbert Renardi Kusila , Tidore, North Maluku\par \par \uc2 When I traveled to three different Indonesian provinces earlier this month, I realized they had an unusual resemblance. Their roads were decorated with huge billboards, where photos of their local leaders were placed, ornamented with their popular tourist spots and a statement: "Eliminate stunting before 2025."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the elections are just about to start. Providing information related to stunting can be used as a campaign tool, especially with increasing \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  health \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  expectations from society after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, what are the proposed policies from these advertisements?\par \par \uc2 A Statistics Indonesia (BPS) survey in 2021 showsthat the population of children aged under five reached 30.83 million. Unfortunately, 24.4 percent of children or around 7.5 million are stunted (Indonesian Nutritional Status Survey, 2021).\par \par \uc2 Hence, Indonesia only succeeded in reducing 6 percent of stunting in this age group in the past three years (in 2018, 30.8 percent of children aged under five were stunted).\par \par \uc2 The Medium-Term National Development Plan has targeted further cutting of the stunting rate to 14 percent in 2024.\par \par \uc2 The government aims to eradicate stunting in children through five pillars, namely commitment, communication, convergence in all stakeholder levels, food security and strengthening innovation in research.\par \par \uc2 In my personal opinion, these pillars have been widely implemented except for the fourth one. The health training, inter-agency meetings, grassroot campaigns and academic conferences have been routinely conducted. However, only limited discussions and interventions in food security have emerged.\par \par \uc2 A simple proof can be seen in our Posyandu (integrated health services post) programs. They explain a lot about stunting initiatives, but what kind of food do they provide during the program?\par \par \uc2 Is the food aimed for the children or the caregiver? Does the food consist of balanced macro and micronutrients?\par \par \uc2 Similarly, we are still struggling to find documented data about food security and specific nutrition intervention programs in the country. The majority of our stunting-related studies are focusing on its social determinants.\par \par \uc2 It is absolutely necessary to understand that lower maternal education, a higher number of household members and living in rural areasare risk factors of stunting.\par \par \uc2 However, when we meet stunted children, should we send their mothers back to school, distribute their household members and move them to less rural areas?\par \par \uc2 This is when the understanding of preventing stunting and curing stunted children are becoming biased. Those social determinants will be impactful to be used in long-term stunting prevention programs, in particular to prevent new stunting cases.\par \par \uc2 Still, for short-term management and to cure those who have already been diagnosed with this condition, we should admit that these promotions, training and campaigns will be less effective or even useless. The only possible way to ameliorate their growth curve to place above the red line is by providing nutritional food.\par \par \uc2 This issue should not be further neglected. The government has warned of a possible food crisis, therefore rice imports are needed. However, can these imports be sustainable?\par \par \uc2 In the face of \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially the imminent global recession, it will not be impossible for nations with higher supplies to prioritize their internal demands, while holding back trade, as prices slowly surge.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, Indonesia should prepare for the worst, due to our nickel dispute with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . Any sanctions can lead to food security disruptions and the underprivileged, who are also strongly associated with higher prevalence of stunting, will be hit hardest.\par \par \uc2 For short-term management and to cure those who have already been diagnosed with this condition, we should admit that these promotions, training and campaigns will be less effective or even useless.\par \par \uc2 What have we done? We are still focusing on community empowerment to overcome this stunting problem, ranging from distributing brochures to creating billboards.\par \par \uc2 If we want to prevent a parasitic worm infection, we give oral antiparasitic medicine every six months and spread information. If we want to eradicate polio, measles, diphtheria or pertussis, we utilize vaccines and distribute information. We respond to dengue outbreaks with fogging and distribute the larvicide (known as Abate) and information. We even have a strong \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  to fortify salt with iodine to prevent hypothyroidism that may lead to cognitive impairment.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, when we talk about stunting, we provide only repetitive information.\par \par \uc2 In a Lancet publication titled "\b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  costs of childhood stunting to the private sector in lowand middle-income countries", the authors predict that Indonesia would lose US$1 billion per month due to stunting. Furthermore, they discovered that for every $1 investment in stunting intervention, the return would multiply to $81.\par \par \uc2 The costs do not take effect later in life from future health burdens. It is happening now! To illustrate this, let's change the word "stunted" with "hungry".\par \par \uc2 Can hungry children concentrate on their studies? Do hungry children have good sleep quality? Can hungry children be creative and innovative? In the end, we will lose many highly skilled future problem-solvers.\par \par \uc2 Countries with a higher human development index seem to understand this better. Therefore, schools in many developed nations provide meals. Their school canteens also serve as a living laboratory in which research on childhood nutritional interventions are widely conducted. Food security and nutrition imbalance are not challenges limited to developing nations.\par \par \uc2 Now, where is Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  standing? Unfortunately, the latest food provision at schools took place during the New Order era. Such a program could be controversial in the current point of view. However, a food provision program can be a tool to deliver diversity of diet, improve feeding practices and encourage better food preparation.\par \par \uc2 A rather rough calculation suggests that if we provide a meal three times a day at a cost of Rp 10,000 (64 US cent) each for these 7.5 million stunted children, we spend less than Rp 7 trillion a month, which is only half of our stunting-associated \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  loss.\par \par \uc2 If we continuously invest in food provision programs, how much money can we save in years? Needless to say, it is definitely a risky initiative, especially when we discuss how a program should be funded. But if we are able to manage it properly, it will prosper us in later years. High risk, high income, isn't it?\par \par \uc2 Many nongovernmental organizations, communities and institutions have started programs akin to food provision on a smaller scale.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, gathering their scattered data is another challenge. We need a more extensive calculation from experts on nutrient dose-related intervention and cost-effectiveness until future projections provide more rigorous evidence.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, as the food security program may go beyond our borders, Indonesia should strengthen international dialogue, agreements and meetings about food security with governments, businesses and peoples. We should use our potential and opportunities to ensure food security.\par \par \uc2 Once a collaboration has been set, it should also include the transfer of knowledge and technology to improve our food availability that involves the production, distribution, and stock saving as well as providing nutrient-dense foods.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the climate-friendly approach should be propagated to ensure environmental and ecosystem sustainability, which will allow Indonesia to achieve not only food security but also food resilience.\par \par \uc2 _________________\par \par \uc2 A medical doctor on Tidore Island, North Maluku, and a research assistant in the Health Management and \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Department in the School of Medicine, \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Health and Nursing, at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221219eicj00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Indonesia mired in 'K-shaped recovery'\b0\par\par\uc2 Dio Suhenda, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 809 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 A recent survey has sounded alarms about inequality on the country's road to recovery, as vulnerable families, including households with disabled members or those that are led by women, are facing tougher challenges to bounce back from the pandemic compared with more well-off families.\par \par \uc2 The survey interviewed close to 11,000 households of different \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions nationwide in February and March of this year, when the country was still reeling from an Omicron-fueled third wave of infections. The respondents in the survey made up nearly 90 percent of households that were polled in November 2020, during the first year of the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 The study that was published last week, along with the findings in November 2020, was a collaborative work between \uc2 UNICEF\uc2 , the \uc2 United Nations Development Program (UNDP)\uc2 , Australia-Indonesia Partnership for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Development (Prospera) and Jakarta-based SMERU Research Institute.\par \par \uc2 They concluded that the nation was mired in a so-called K-shaped recovery in which "the wealthiest households were emerging from pandemic-induced \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  setbacks while the rest were stagnating or even deteriorating". The phenomenon suggests that there is a trend toward a widening wealth gap.\par \par \uc2 The survey found that one in three families depended for their income on a small business they ran and six in 10 family-owned businesses were now operating as usual. There were also fewer people who reported heightened anxiety and mental depression, down from 25.4 percent in 2020 to 17.6 percent this year.\par \par \uc2 Households in the top income quintile in the survey said they had recovered around 20 percent of their income after a 29 percent income drop due to the pandemic. But the bottom quintile of households had only recovered 15 percent of their income from a 37 percent drop. The survey did not detail income between different groups.\par \par \uc2 The survey noted how households struggling to recover were usually those with disabled members, families that were led by women and families that were led by a man or woman whose educational background was not higher than middle school.\par \par \uc2 These vulnerable families were also more likely to resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  pressure, including borrowing money from relatives, friends or loan sharks, selling or pawning their belongings and even eating less to reduce their food \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This also coincides with an additional 1.47 million households being food insecure this year, compared with 2020 data.\par \par \uc2 Gender inequality\par \par \uc2 The survey found increasing trends of gender inequality, with women often having to juggle job and home.\par \par \uc2 Around 65 percent of children relied on their mothers to help them during their online schooling, compared with 25 percent of children who relied on their fathers. Seventy percent of families also left the responsibilities of doing household chores to women. Despite this, around 45 percent of women who helped their children learn at home had full-time jobs.\par \par \uc2 The survey also found that women were disproportionately disadvantaged in the pandemic-battered job market, with female workers being four times more likely to have stopped working in 2022 than male workers.\par \par \uc2 Of the women who were in the workforce in 2019, some 32 percent are still currently unemployed this year. Meanwhile, only 8.9 percent of men who worked in 2019 are still currently unemployed.\par \par \uc2 Conversely, two-thirds of women who started working in 2022 could only land a less stable option of informal jobs this year.\par \par \uc2 Combating inequality\par \par \uc2 One of the survey's lead researchers, Athia Yumna of SMERU, said the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  looming over vulnerable families had only been further exacerbated in recent months.\par \par \uc2 "[These families] are still [facing] three additional threats: climate change, a global conflict [stemming from the Russian invasion in Ukraine that triggered a global food crisis] and the rising costs of living in the country," Athia said.\par \par \uc2 She added that families in Indonesia were also facing the risk of further \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  setbacks, should the country's COVID-19 cases and deaths rise again.\par \par \uc2 To this end, she said the government had to nip the rising \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  inequality by improving its social aid programs.\par \par \uc2 "The government needs to ensure that the existing social protection systems can provide a comprehensive and inclusive cushion for all families in their different life cycles," she said, adding that this should also include gender-sensitive measures to address the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  pressure faced by women.\par \par \uc2 Maniza Zaman, a \uc2 UNICEF\uc2  representative in Indonesia, said the survey had "underpinned the importance of improving the social protection system" to ensure that no one was left behind in the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery efforts.\par \par \uc2 "Addressing this issue is key for Indonesia to achieve its long-term vision of becoming one of the world's 10 largest economies by 2030 and reducing all forms of poverty to near zero," Zaman said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221220eick0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR) is supporting the Indonesian government in developing the potential of renewable energy in the country, a member of Commission VII of the DPR, Mukhtarudin, has said.\par \par \uc2 "We in the DPR are giving support, including by proposing the New Energy and Renewable Energy Bill, in which one of the emphases is accelerating the use of new and renewable energy," he affirmed in a written statement issued here on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The government has made several policies to optimize food and energy so that the nation no longer needs to depend on their supplies from abroad, Mukhtarudin noted. He made the observation on the basis of a statement made by the Coordinating Ministry for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Affairs, which emphasized that the demand and potential for renewable energy in Indonesia are increasing.\par \par \uc2 "The data showed that Indonesia has a consistent addition of renewable energy in the overall energy mix. This is positive progress in shifting energy use in Indonesia to green energy," he explained.\par \par \uc2 The legislator emphasized that Indonesia is in a central position in the global energy transition management. The Energy Commission of DPR is providing support, for example, for various policies that favor a better future for Indonesians.\par \par \uc2 He expressed his support for the optimism of President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2 , who is aiming to make Indonesia a developed country. Moreover, Indonesia has enormous natural resources in the energy sector, including renewable energy sources, which have vast potential and are abundant.\par \par \uc2 "Many say that the current situation and condition of the world \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  are not good. Yet, Indonesia has so far been relatively stable. This is the point of how we deal with global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he said.\par \par \uc2 He urged the government to be consistent in implementing policies in the energy ecosystem, including in terms of the downstreaming of mining products, the creation of an electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem, and the push for domestic component level (TKDN).\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RAP/A/R013/R013) 21-12-2022 01:03:35\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221220eicl002jq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b  \highlight22\uc2 Economy \highlight\uc2  headed into uncharted waters in 2023\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 897 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Both the government and businesses expect difficult \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions in 2023, mainly as a result of the geopolitical tensions caused by the war in Ukraine, which will continue to create \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a forum held by the Coordinating \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Ministry revolving around next year's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook, President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  acknowledged that the country was bracing for a situation that was "not easy", "hard to predict" and "hard to measure".\par \par \uc2 He underlined that traditional \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies were no longer sufficient to deal with current global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil, as inflation around the world remained high, followed by subsequent high \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Everything that has happened has not been in accordance with the set of knowledge that we possess," President Jokowi told forum participants on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the same event, Finance Minister \uc2 Sri Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  highlighted that several factors had contributed to the persisting issues on the supply and demand sides, which are both crucial aspects to the growth of Indonesian enterprises.\par \par \uc2 On the supply side, the minister explained that \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  sanction blowouts between Russia and the Western allies had disrupted the global supply of key commodities, causing oil, gas and food prices to rise above historical levels.\par \par \uc2 On the demand side, meanwhile, there had been a slight opportunity for recovery as the global pandemic threat had begun to dissipate while labor markets remained "unpredictable", thus creating a "tight labor" situation in developed countries.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 , labor tightness is a situation in which huge job opportunities are opened but the talent pool is not sufficient to fill the gap, which leads to upward pressure on wages and thus inflation.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot know the geopolitical settlement of negotiations between Russia, Europe and Ukraine," the minister said, stressing that "it creates \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  which, by its nature, cannot to be predicted in [normal] \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  terms".\par \par \uc2 Due to stubborn inflation in the developed countries, the finance chief explained that their monetary authorities were left with the only option to raise \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  and tighten liquidity to an "extreme" degree.\par \par \uc2 Such policies would cause an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown for these countries, she said, while Indonesia's challenge in 2023 would be "keeping an eye on the global environment", in particular the war-induced slowdown in Europe and the Chinese struggle to open its \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  alongside increasing cases of COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 She expects export growth to "normalize" next year, due to the high baseline this year and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  erosion of Indonesia's major markets, a situation that incentivizes the government to look into nontraditional markets such as India and the Middle East as alternative export destinations.\par \par \uc2 Investment, meanwhile, will be affected by rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which will determine investors' appetite for risk. The government, nonetheless, will still do everything to spur investment growth by at least beyond 6 percent in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Financial Services Authority (OJK) \uc2 chairperson Mahendra Siregar said it would continue monitoring the restructuring schemes in sectors that are still battered by the pandemic, including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and tourism.\par \par \uc2 Businesses projection\par \par \uc2 As for labor-intensive industries, such as textiles and footwear, he said that the OJK was considering extending the restructuring program for one more year, as these industries were affected by sluggish demand in the global market.\par \par \uc2 "The financial sector, as the lifeblood of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , should also be directed to strengthening national priorities," Mahendra said.\par \par \uc2 In a separate event on Wednesday, Indonesia Employers Association (Apindo) chairperson Hariyadi Sukamdani projected that layoffs would continue in 2023 as there had not been any signs of a rebound by export-oriented industries, such as textiles and furniture.\par \par \uc2 He said that according to Workers Social Security Agency (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) data, almost 920,000 workers had been laid off from January to November this year.\par \par \uc2 Against such conditions, businesses believe that next year's investment will be focused on capital-intensive projects, while labor-intensive projects will see a reduction in capital injection.\par \par \uc2 "Investment will continue [to grow], but in terms of employment, it is still a problem for all of us," Hariyadi told reporters.\par \par \uc2 He also complained about government policies, such as import duties, that restrict imports of raw materials for the manufacturing of value-added goods, thus hampering the growth of several sectors.\par \par \uc2 Regarding another challenge for next year, former finance minister under then-president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Chatib Basri, said that the United States was on the track to bring its own \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  into recession to curb inflation.\par \par \uc2 Due to the mismatch between supply and demand in the labor market, Chatib said that the US would enter a recession as unemployment will likely rise from the current 3.7 percent to as high as 10 percent in the span of a year, a situation that will lead to aggressive rate hikes by the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 If these policies are in line, the US could see inflation beginning to drop by the end of 2023, Chatib said, which means \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  would have to raise its benchmark rates to close the gap.\par \par \uc2 As monetary \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  remains focused on stability, it will be prudent for the \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  authorities to bolster consumers' purchasing power.\par \par \uc2 "When I was a kid, my mom used to tell me that being frugal meant being rich. But in the face of this crisis, \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  will mean recovery," Chatib said.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221221eicl00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Head of the Research Center for Macroeconomics and Finance of the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), Zamroni Salim, has projected that Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  will grow well in the range of 4.9\u8211\'20\'135.2 percent in 2023.\par \par \uc2 "In facing the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023, BRIN predicts Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can still grow well," he said at the \u8220\'20\'1CSymposium of \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Practitioners and Researchers\u8221\'20\'1D held by BRIN and the Indonesian Researchers Association (PPI) here on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 According to Salim, the projection for Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in 2023 is based on optimism that the country"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance will start to improve in the fourth quarter of 2022, with growth reaching 5.4 percent.\par \par \uc2 To make the most of the momentum, the government, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the private sector, and the community need to anticipate the problem of inflation, especially in food and energy, exchange rates, and the active trade sector, supported by investment and production in the agricultural and manufacturing industries.\par \par \uc2 "We also need to optimize the reallocation of some of the energy \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidy\b0 \highlight\uc2  funds. This is done to improve the ability to reduce the worst possibility of a recession that threatens in 2023, especially for people below the poverty line," he said.\par \par \uc2 He expressed optimism that, with those steps, Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth can be expedited, especially after the easing of restrictions on \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activities due to the improvement in pandemic handling.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the head of BRIN, Laksana Tri Handoko, said that Indonesia is one of the countries that have shown resilience in facing global crises.\par \par \uc2 In the past three years, the world has faced several crises caused by the pandemic and the geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine, he noted.\par \par \uc2 Handoko further said that Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience can be seen from its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth. In 2020, Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth touched minus 2.07 percent.

This marks a significant improvement from the 5.71 percent increase seen in the preceding months.\par \par \uc2 He said the headline inflation would continue to decline in Indonesia, reaching below 4 percent by the second half of next year.\par \par \uc2 However, the pressures from external shocks remain strong, leading the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  to introduce policies aimed at stabilizing the rupiah.\par \par \uc2 "The \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  to stabilize the exchange rate of the rupiah continues to be strengthened to control imported inflation, in addition to mitigating the spillover effects of the still strong US dollar and high global financial market \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Perry said.\par \par \uc2 Perry said that \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  also introduced a new foreign exchange operation instrument, allowing domestic banks to keep export proceeds, specifically those derived from natural resources, with the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  at more competitive rates than overseas banks.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  expected its latest policies\u8212\'20\'14including easing the minimum reserve requirements for banks with loans to small and medium enterprises, 43 prioritized sectors, and sustainable financing\u8212\'20\'14should allow more room for the country to maintain its growth recovery.\par \par \uc2 Perry said the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2  now projected Indonesia's $1 trillion \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  should expand by around 4.9 percent next year, at the midpoint of its projection range of 4.5-5.3 percent.\par \par \uc2 Document JGLOBE0020221222eicm00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Commodities boom sees surge in investment\b0\par\par\uc2 Divya Karyza, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia experienced a massive increase in metals and metal goods investments this year on the back of soaring commodities prices, a trend that some experts believe might be prolonged in line with the global shift towardrenewables and electric vehicles (EVs).\par \par \uc2 Investment Ministry data showed that the basic metal productionand metal goods industries grabbed the largest share of foreign investments realized in the third quarter of 2022 at US$8.4 billion, followed by mining at $3.4 billion.\par \par \uc2 "Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is still heavy on commodities, so this year's commodities boom had a significant role in pulling in foreign investments," Ahmad Zuhdi Dwi Kusuma, an industry and area analyst at state-owned lender \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2 , toldThe Jakarta Poston Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Investments in the metals and mining sector were also influenced by long-term investment in strategic metals critical to the energy transition, such as nickel, he added.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia maintained its trade surplus for a 31st consecutive month in November to reach a sizeable US$ 5.16 billion surplus, even as exports and imports both slowed precipitously.\par \par \uc2 Exports grew 5.6 percent year-on-year (yoy) on the back of recovery in industrial metals prices as China ended its strict lockdowns, publicly listedBank Central Asia (BCA) senior economist Barra Kukuh Mamia wrote in a report published on Dec. 15.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, the small rise in crude palm oil (CPO) exports since June appeared to be receding, with figures in October temporarily propped up by the Diwali holiday in India.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, data from the \uc2 Indonesia Stock Exchange\uc2  (IDX) showed that coal shares in the Indonesian Composite Index (IHSG) rose 66 percent year-to-date (ytd) on average.\par \par \uc2 "This is mainly supported by soaring coal prices," Fauzan Luthfi Djamal, a mining analyst with RHB Sekuritas, said on Dec. 19.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's coal boom was driven by a combination of \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing prolonged war, which forced several European countries to limit the use of natural gas and instead burn more coal for electricity production.\par \par \uc2 Other mining commodities, including copper, aluminum, nickel and tin, also enjoyed price increases alongside issues related to inflation, appreciation of the US dollar and low inventories, Fauzan said.\par \par \uc2 Massive investment boon\par \par \uc2 Investment grew 35.2 percent yoyin the first three quarters of the year, driven by solid growth in domestic direct investment (DDI) and exceptional growth in foreign direct investment (FDI).\par \par \uc2 The destination countries that gained major investments were those exporting energy or battery metals and those relocating their factories from China, BCA senior economist Barra stated in a separate report published on Nov. 11.\par \par \uc2 "Indonesia clearly belongs in the first group," he added.\par \par \uc2 The commodities boom centered on energy transition metals, including aluminum, copper, cobalt and lithium, particularly as renewables and EVs led the consumption drive, Theo Yameogo, EY Americas and Canada mining and metals leader, wrote in an article published on Sept. 11.\par \par \uc2 However, their contributions to overall consumption might remain low, considering the possibility of a global structural slowdown impacting infrastructure projects.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia has been counted among the select few countries projected to experience relatively strong growth in 2023, according to Barra, as the country, an exporter of metals used in batteries or renewable energy production, had seen a strong investment trend in metals and mining this year.\par \par \uc2 Looking ahead\par \par \uc2 Metal balances were looking more optimistic in 2024 in light of macroeconomic indicators and a projection that the coming global recession in 2023 would not be "as bad as expected", which would indirectly cause the dollar index to weaken, said the \uc2 RHB\uc2 's Fauzan.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, China's relaxed zero-COVID \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was expected to increase thedemand for base metals.\par \par \uc2 "In the long term, the global shift toward renewables and EVs is expected to continue increasing base metals demand, including nickel," said Fauzan.\par \par \uc2 "EV adoption and renewable energy development in Indonesia would still be a defining factor next year," he added.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia holds more than a fifth of the world's \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  of nickel, a primary material used in lithium-ion batteries in most EVs. Australia is the only other country with equally large \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  of around 21 million tonnes, according to a March 2022 report in Statista.Indonesia also has the world's third-largest \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  of cobalt, another vital chemical element.\par \par \uc2 The archipelagic country is projected to become the world's fourth-largest producer of green commodities by 2030, only behind Australia, Chile and Mongolia, according toThe Economist.\par \par \uc2 The government is banking on the country's abundance of energy transition resources to fuel an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  revival, stimulating \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and putting a stop to two decades of deindustrialization.\par \par \uc2 Fauzan expected the benchmark Newcastle coal futures to hover at an average $200 per tonne in 2023, though he predicted nickel prices could fluctuate around the current price of $28,000 per tonne.\par \par \uc2 "The [price] trajectory remains positive compared to the past four to five years. Closing prices at the end of next year could still be higher than the current average, at least," he said.\par \par \uc2 According to Energy and Mineral Resources data, the government had set its coal benchmark price in October at a record high of $330.97 per tonne as demand from Europe rose, up from $319.22 per tonne in September.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia is the world's biggest exporter of thermal coal.\par \par \uc2 The mineral benchmark price (HMA) for nickel, aluminum and copper in April hit an all-time high since Indonesia introduced the reference in 2017, before the it fluctuated downward and slightly upward to reach respectively $23,907, $2,282 and $7,890 per dry tonnein December.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221226eicq00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NATIONAL NEWS\par \b \uc2 READY TO MONITOR PRESIDENT'S FIVE PRIORITY AGENDAS: KSP\b0\par\par\uc2 677 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 December 2022\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By Azis Kurmala\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Presidential Staff Office (KSP) is ready to oversee the five priority agendas of President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) and Vice President \uc2 Ma"ruf Amin\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s administration in 2023.\par \par \uc2 The five priority agendas are downstreaming and industrializing natural resources; optimizing clean energy sources and enhancing the green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 ; increasing legal, social, political, and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  protection for the people; continuing the digitization of the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  so that Indonesian micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can immediately upgrade their class; and ensuring the sustainable development of the new capital (IKN) Nusantara and the National Strategic Program.\par \par \uc2 "KSP will oversee and ensure that the priority agenda and policies of the President are not only sent, but (seep) properly down to the lower levels," the head of KSP, Moeldoko, said in Jakarta on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In 2022, the KSP carried out the tasks assigned by the President, namely overseeing national priority programs and the national strategic program (PSN), he informed.\par \par \uc2 Even though facing a rather difficult situation in 2021\u8211\'20\'132022, the KSP managed to work well.\par \par \uc2 "I have also received an order to map out the conditions of the many national strategic programs," he said.\par \par \uc2 Moeldoko further said that in 2023, the world is expected to face situations full of turmoil, \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , complexity, and ambiguity, which will move dynamically and be difficult to predict.\par \par \uc2 By understanding these complex conditions, Indonesia is expected to formulate an appropriate crisis management strategy to ensure that all goals can be achieved, he added.\par \par \uc2 Despite the geopolitical conflicts and crises that are continuing to haunt the world, the five big national agendas must continue to be pursued to achieve the Advanced Indonesia goal, President Widodo emphasized earlier.\par \par \uc2 The agendas are aimed at developing an inclusive, fair, and sustainable Indonesia, the President said during the annual session of the People"s Consultative Assembly (MPR) and the joint session of the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR) and the Regional Representatives Council (DPD) at the Parliamentary Complex here on August 16, 2022.\par \par \uc2 "The nation"s grand agenda must not stop. Great efforts must continue to be made. There are at least five big agendas that I have emphasized earlier," he added.\par \par \uc2 The first of the five big agendas involves the downstreaming and industrialization of natural resources.\par \par \uc2 The President informed that the downstreaming of the nickel industry led to an 18-fold increase in the exports of iron and steel. In addition to \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  revenue, the country"s foreign exchange is expected to rise so the rupiah exchange rate will remain stable.\par \par \uc2 According to Widodo, Indonesia should build an integrated ecosystem for the industry that will support the development of the global green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 The second agenda involves the optimization of green energy sources and lays emphasis on improving the green \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As for the third agenda, Widodo called for continuing efforts to strengthen the community"s legal, social, political, and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  protection.\par \par \uc2 He emphasized that the realization of civil rights and democratic practices as well as the political rights of women and the rights of marginalized communities must be guaranteed.\par \par \uc2 The fourth agenda aims to continuously support MSMEs to level up. The government has continued to boost \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  digitalization to empower MSMEs, thereby leading to the development of 2 decacorn companies and 9 unicorn companies, he said.\par \par \uc2 According to the President, at least 19 million MSMEs have entered the digital ecosystem, and the figure is targeted to reach 30 million by 2024.\par \par \uc2 The fifth agenda highlighted by the President is that the construction of the national capital of Nusantara (IKN) must not stall.\par \par \uc2 "The IKN is not only for state civil apparatus but also a city of innovators and entrepreneurs. The city will not only house government offices, but it will also become a new \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  driving force. It will not only be an ordinary city but it will be a forest city with world-class education and health services," he said.\par \par \uc2 (T.A063/A/H-SHT/H-SHT) 27-12-2022 23:34:59\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221227eicr002e5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Government's 2023 tourism targets fail to inspire businesses\b0\par\par\uc2 Deni Ghifari, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 759 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Tourism and Creative \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Ministry has laid out its tourism targets for next year, but industry players have dismissed them as unambitious and say better \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 -private coordination is needed to support the sector in its ongoing recovery.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Tourism and Creative \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister \uc2 Sandiaga Uno\uc2  announced that 2022's target of 3.5 million foreign tourist visits had been achieved, with 3.92 million visits as of October.\par \par \uc2 Next year's foreign visitor target, meanwhile, is set in the relatively wide range of 3.5 to 7.4 million visits, still a fraction of the pre-pandemic 2019 target of 20 million visits.\par \par \uc2 Association of Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies (ASITA) vice chairman Budijanto Ardiansjah said the numbers presented by Sandiaga were predictable, given that tourist activity had indeed increased in 2022, although it had remained well below pre-pandemic levels.\par \par \uc2 But he voiced concerns that as a political campaign year, 2023 could bring challenges to the tourism industry.\par \par \uc2 "As long as the government can keep it conducive for tourism, the sector can thrive and reach its targets," he toldThe Jakarta Poston Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Budijanto deemed the 2023 targets "pessimistic", as the bar had not been set very high.\par \par \uc2 "So, if they surpass the targets, I don't think that's anything extraordinary. Nevertheless, [ASITA] still appreciates what the government has done. I think Indonesia is currently in the international spotlight. We've done a pretty good job at promoting [tourism] abroad [...] and this certainly is a huge opportunity for us," Budijanto added.\par \par \uc2 On top of foreign visitor figures, Sandiaga announced that the tourism industry had brought in US$4.26 billion in foreign exchange earnings, ten times last year's earnings.\par \par \uc2 "This year was the turning point for our tourism," Sandiaga said.\par \par \uc2 "The target for foreign exchange earnings was set at $1.7 billion, meaning what we've achieved is three times as much."\par \par \uc2 Sandiaga noted that tourism accounted for some 3.6 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) this year, double last year's figure. The government had set next year's target at 4.1 percent.\par \par \uc2 "The government sets next year's [target for GDP contribution] by reviewing this year's tourism performance. If the current situation stands, that target is within reach or at least we will get close," ASITA's Budijanto noted.\par \par \uc2 "However, the government must use this GDP contribution for better promotion so that the tourism sector can grow uninterrupted," he added.\par \par \uc2 Budijanto noted how unaligned the government and industry players had been in terms of strategic planning.\par \par \uc2 "When it comes to strategy, sometimes what the government has in mind is different from what the industry players have. That is sensible because each has their own perspective [...]. The important thing is to find the middle ground," said Budijanto.\par \par \uc2 The industry needed policies that could push tourism further, he said, as not all current regulations were contributing positively to the sector.\par \par \uc2 Budijanto suggested the government consider universal \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  exemption for tourism players--whether big or small--as the sector was only in the early stages of recovery. He also proposed targeted \b \highlight22\uc2 subsidies\b0 \highlight\uc2  to encourage domestic tourism.\par \par \uc2 ASITA president Nunung Rusmiati said the achievements the government had touted did not fully reflect the reality on the ground.\par \par \uc2 "In the field, the condition is not aligned with what the government is trying to achieve because the priorities are in line with needs and funds. Meanwhile, not all industry players' needs have been fulfilled, but this is understandable," said Rusmiati.\par \par \uc2 She said next year's biggest challenge for the sector would be a possible global recession and macroeconomic \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  due to the war in Ukraine. The ministry's multistakeholder studies, she added, had been helpful for the industry as a whole.\par \par \uc2 Azril Azahari, a professor at Ambarrukmo Tourism University, claimed "the government made many mistakes. It must be criticized".\par \par \uc2 He said the government was still using the outdated "mass tourism" paradigm, which focused on numbers of tourists above all else and generally took the view of "the bigger, the better".\par \par \uc2 He said policies such as visas on arrival, second home visas and cheap tourism were part of the mass tourism paradigm, which he claimed had to change.\par \par \uc2 He maintained that the government instead needed to focus on improving metrics such as length of stay and money spent per visitor.\par \par \uc2 "Every other country is thinking about how to make tourists stay longer and spend more money," said Azril.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221227eicr00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 The 12 crazy months of the  \highlight22\uc2 economy \highlight\uc2  in 2022\b0\par\par\uc2 1,210 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Helen Wong , Jakarta\par \par \uc2 After my nine-year-old daughter made me memorize the lyrics to "12 Days of Christmas" this year, I found myself with a mug by the fireplace recapping the 12 crazy months of 2022 and how they impacted Southeast Asia's start-ups and tech investors.\par \par \uc2 In the first days of January, my true love sent to me, a radical career change. After more than 15 years, I decided to make the jump from the large, polished, homogenized tech market of China to the budding, fragmented, messy and unvarnished landscape that is Southeast Asia. I joined AC Ventures, whose partners I felt had the most complementary experience to my global skillset.\par \par \uc2 In February, Russia dramatically invaded Ukraine, which came as a shock to many of my European peers. Most did not expect to wake up to a war on their doorstep. Tied to the tech market was the energy crisis that quickly unfolded. The need for nations to diversify energy sources took center stage. This was actually an odd macroeconomic boon for Indonesia, though, as commodities exports surged and the stock market performed better than most.\par \par \uc2 Our firm also has a focus on environment, social and governance (ESG) investing and this currently includes a push to back innovative climate-tech and renewable energy start-ups. With the whole world looking for energy diversification in 2022, our conviction was fortified.\par \par \uc2 In March, the Zilingo scandal grabbed headlines and a fresh debate over the need for better corporate governance in start-ups began to rage. Personally, I could never wrap my head around Zilingo. It felt like we'd missed something when \uc2 Temasek\uc2  led its last round and brought it to a near-unicorn valuation. I had trouble understanding where the company's users came from and how its different business units fit together (e.g. offering financing to help your merchants buy from you?).\par \par \uc2 After a whistleblower's report led to the removal of Zilingo's CEO, start-ups and investors began drilling into the root cause. We all know that corporate governance here has never been particularly stringent. But now with fewer avenues to proper liquidity for investors in the tech game, this became a fiery topic.\par \par \uc2 In April, Shanghai went into full lockdown and my family was trapped before making our "great escape" from China. The experience really made me question the risks of centralized government.\par \par \uc2 It was also this month that GoTo went \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  on the \uc2 Indonesia Stock Exchange\uc2 . This was a true milestone for ASEAN's digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It's true that today the stock is not looking so good. Like most tech start-ups that went \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  over the past two years, local tech companies still need to show their ability to reach profitability and demonstrate long-term viability.\par \par \uc2 In May, Terra's blockchain native token Luna crashed. This triggered a domino effect that brought on a wider crypto collapse, including Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The Singapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund was soon ordered to liquidate.\par \par \uc2 A lot of folks thought the 3AC guys were geniuses because they were making so much money. But it turned out that they were just using higher leverage than other players. So in the same way that they could be the winners during a bull market, they were also brought to their knees in a bear market.\par \par \uc2 In June, inflation hit a whopping 9.1 percent and there was a risk of stagflation.\par \par \uc2 Fear gripped the global market about the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2  raising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  at a faster pace, which could have negative effects on the global venture capital space.\par \par \uc2 It was certainly not good news for the VC industry, as cheap money had previously fueled explosive growth in tech and risky assets. As 10-year US dollar treasuries started earning 4 percent, tech companies' \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  future cash flows became far less appealing. However, top-quartile firms remain attractive due to their superior returns. There will continue to be a mass migration to top venture firms, and we're just seeing the start of it.\par \par \uc2 In July, \uc2 MissFresh\uc2 , a publicly listed unicorn in the fresh groceries e-commerce space, saw its market capitalization drop from US$2.5 billion to $12 million in one year. The company's financial reporting was delayed and the previous year's numbers were revealed to be inflated.\par \par \uc2 MissFresh\uc2  initially had good unit economics, but raised too much money ($1.7 billion) and expanded too aggressively, leading to problems such as corruption and skewed financials. When it became clear that the company had only a few months of cash left, \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  investors sold off their stock and the stampede began.\par \par \uc2 August was a good month for me. AC Ventures completed the first close of its new fund, thanks to supportive backers. Southeast Asia still has strong demographic trends and maturing supply chains thanks to geopolitical evolution, as well as ongoing digital transformation across industries. Naturally, investors have different risk assessments of the global slowdown and inflationary environment. But overall, it feels like a relatively warm winter in our region.\par \par \uc2 In September, coinciding with the SuperReturn Asia conference, articles about Singapore's popularity circulated on \uc2 WeChat\uc2 , with many Chinese investors telling me they're considering setting up offices here and putting capital to work in Southeast Asian startups. That said, most are still more comfortable investing in Chinese founders and are unwilling to completely give up on the China market. Founders should consider how much time investors are \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the region to gauge their true level of interest.\par \par \uc2 In October, the annual \uc2 Google\uc2 -\uc2 Temasek\uc2  report announced that the Southeast Asian digital \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  reached $200 billion three years ahead of projections. The report remained optimistic despite slower growth in overall digital penetration compared to levels during the pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, I had never seen such pessimism from my Chinese friends, which made me think that things were primed for a rebound. China stocks hit rock bottom and only began to recover as Zero Covid policies began to unwind after mass protests took place across China.\par \par \uc2 In November, as if 2022 wasn't wild enough, FTX burned to the ground in spectacular fashion. \uc2 Binance\uc2 , a competitor and former shareholder, dumped FTX tokens, causing the exchange to go bust. The ensuing drama could not have been written by the best Hollywood writers. Corporate governance was once again top of mind, and news emerged about the complicity of media and influencers that were "bought" by SBF. In this age of social media and clickbait, we must be doubly wary of who we follow and trust.\par \par \uc2 Now at the end of December, I feel it has been a sobering year overall. The times of fast growth and excesses seem to demand their payback with headlines about falling stocks and tech company layoffs. Some experts are more pessimistic about this down cycle compared to previous ones, as it marks the start of a new era with no more cheap money and a longer-term slowdown in global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth.\par \par \uc2 That said, \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  projects Indonesia will be the fourth largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2050, so I think I'm in the right place.\par \par \uc2 ________________\par \par \uc2 A managing partner at AC Ventures\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221229eict00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Govt eyeing import ban, manufacturing  \highlight22\uc2 subsidies \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 685 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2022 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Industry Ministry has laid out plans to boost state revenue from manufacturing in 2023, claiming the sector could grow up to 5.4 percent next year despite weak international demand for Indonesia's non-commodity goods.\par \par \uc2 Industry Minister \uc2 Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita\uc2  said on Tuesday that although the COVID-19 pandemic had subsided, global inflation remained high and the war in Ukraine had created \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  regarding supply and demand.\par \par \uc2 According to Industry Ministry data, non-oil and gas manufacturing growth in the second and third quarters of 2022 was below gross domestic product (GDP) growth, reversing the trend in the first quarter, where the sector outpaced GDP growth with 5.47 percent year-on-year (yoy) growth.\par \par \uc2 However, manufactured goods still made up 16.10 percent of GDP in the third quarter, while also accounting for 70.81 percent of the country's exports in the year to November.\par \par \uc2 Agus noted that several challenges had hampered the growth of the sector in 2022. Nonetheless, he expected the manufacturing industry to have grown 5.01 percent by the end of 2022 and to grow 5.1 to 5.4 percent in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Exports of manufactured goods in 2022 were expected to have risen about 18.7 percent yoy to US$210.38 billion, while 2023's forecasts were in the range of $225 billion to $245 billion.\par \par \uc2 "There is pressure as a result of lower factory output amid lower global demand and faster expansion in the non-manufacturing sector," Agus told reporters.\par \par \uc2 He said the pressure on the textile, footwear and furniture industries was particularly "heavy", as their major export markets, the United States and Europe, faced depressed demand.\par \par \uc2 One priority for manufacturing in 2023, Agus said, was revitalizing machinery and tools in the textile subsector. The ministry had allocated Rp 8.09 billion to provide reimbursements of 10 percent of the total value of imported machinery and 25 percent of the value of equipment purchased domestically.\par \par \uc2 Agus added that he had proposed several options to support the textile, footwear and furniture industries to Coordinating \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2  in a meeting in December.\par \par \uc2 He said a three- to six-month "limited import ban" on textiles was likely to be approved, a \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  textile manufacturers had been pushing for.\par \par \uc2 The government was also considering increased border inspections to combat alleged "dumping" by "certain countries". Agus said such countries had been exporting textiles to Indonesia as demand in their own domestic markets had fallen.\par \par \uc2 Other proposed policies included a relaxation of the 40-hour workweek, flexibility for firms to determine working hours and the expansion of the export market.\par \par \uc2 "Because of its urgent nature, the government will utilize the available instruments that are [able to be quickly deployed]," Agus said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Finance Ministry \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  special staffer Titik Anas said there were "joint forces" between the government and businesses to support manufacturing exports.\par \par \uc2 As such, Titik continued, the government should ask for more from business players with regard to market expansion.\par \par \uc2 "The synergy between the speed of our businesses to capture new markets and facilitation capability by our government should be increased," Titik said on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Indonesian Footwear Association (Aprisindo) executive director Firman Bakrie said the packages proposed by the Industry Ministry were "holistic".\par \par \uc2 He said the move to more stringent border inspections would result in more detailed import data and limit deviations.\par \par \uc2 The proposed import ban, he added, would be temporary and would require further review when the \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  took effect.\par \par \uc2 "What we need now is speed on how fast the recommendations become regulations," Firman toldThe Jakarta Poston Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Center of Economics and Law Studies (CELIOS) executive director Bhima Yudhistira said on Wednesday that a limited import ban could reduce high imports of textile, footwear and furniture products.\par \par \uc2 He said the government should impose more stringent customs measures to prevent Indonesians from returning from abroad with lots of overseas goods to resell to domestic buyers.\par \par \uc2 "Communication with foreign brands regarding prioritization for local products should be facilitated by the government," Bhima told thePost.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020221229eict0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Coordinating Minister for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  AffairsAirlangga Hartartohighlighted that Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Lieu of Law (Perppu) Number 2 of 2022 on Job Creation will provide legal certainty to increase investment in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 "Legal certainty in investment is important. Therefore, the issuance of Perppu Number 2 of 2022 is expected to fulfill the need of legal certainty. This will become the implementation of the Constitutional Court"s decision," he stated at the Presidential Office in Jakarta on Friday.\par \par \uc2 According to Hartarto, the Perppu is also the answer for business owners waiting for the continuation of the Job Creation Law after it was declared conditionally unconstitutional through Constitutional Court Decision Number 91/PUU-XVII/2020 MK.\par \par \uc2 He affirmed that the Perppu will become an instrument of legal certainty and support the government"s target of attracting investment of Rp1,400 trillion in 2023 as well as keeping the 2023 State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  below three percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\par \par \uc2 "Next year, we need investment amounting to Rp1,400 trillion. That is not an ordinary figure because previously, the state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  target for investment was only around Rp900 trillion. This is not an easy challenge,\u8221\'20\'1D the minister remarked.\par \par \uc2 Hartarto also explained that the government"s consideration to issue the Perppu was based on the urgency to anticipate the impact of increasing global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe consideration is an urgent need. The government needs to accelerate the anticipation of good global conditions related to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . We are facing a global recession, rising inflation, and the threat of stagflation as well," he added.\par \par \uc2 He remarked that several regulations refined in Perppu Number 2 of 2022 were related to employment, specifically regarding minimum wages, outsourced workers, synchronization of the Law on Harmonization of \b \highlight22\uc2 Tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  Regulations, and financial relations between the central government and regional governments (HKPD).\par \par \uc2 "(Other changes) improvement are related to water resources and correction of typo errors or references to legal drafting articles, as well as other non-substantial errors, which are refined in accordance with discussions with relevant ministries and institutions and have also been communicated to academics," he stated.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RST/A/R013/R013) 30-12-2022 16:37:11\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020221230eicu000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Gov't Issues  \highlight22\uc2 Regulation \highlight\uc2  in Lieu of Job Creation Law to Avoid Annulment\b0\par\par\uc2 487 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 December 2022\par \uc2 The Jakarta Globe\par \uc2 JGLOBE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. PT Jakarta Globe Media. \par \par \uc2 Jakarta. President Joko \u8220\'20\'1CJokowi\u8221\'20\'1D Widodo on Friday inked an emergency \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on job creation law, about a year after the Constitutional Court declared the so-called omnibus law \u8216\'20\'18conditionally unconstitutional\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 According to Chief \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister Airlangga, launching the presidential \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of the law on job creation was necessary to guard against the grim global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is an urgent need [for the emergency \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 ]. The government needs to speed up anticipatory measures for global conditions, including those related to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . We are facing a global recession, rising inflation, and stagflation threats,\u8221\'20\'1D Airlangga told reporters on Friday.\par \par \uc2 More countries are lining up to receive assistance from the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  (\uc2 IMF\uc2 ), thus painting a grim picture of the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Not to mention the Russia-Ukraine war, coupled with the food and energy crises, as well as climate change.\par \par \uc2 The Constitutional Court in Nov. 2021 declared the controversial Job Creation Law as \u8220\'20\'1Cconditionally unconstitutional\u8221\'20\'1D because its formation did not follow the mandatory procedures. The court gave the government two years to amend the law following the formal \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  process. But if the government did not do as told past the deadline, the \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  would be deemed \u8220\'20\'1Cpermanently unconstitutional\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 "Constitutionally, this Perppu replaces the Job Creation law," Airlangga said.\par \par \uc2 Read More:\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://jakartaglobe.id/business/govt-businesses-find-reprieve-after-court-declares-2020-job-creation-law-unconstitutional/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Gov't, Businesses Find Reprieve After Court Declares 2020 Job Creation Law Unconstitutional}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://jakartaglobe.id/business/finance-minister-confident-indonesia-to-remain-bright-spot-in-global-economy"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Finance Minister Confident Indonesia to Remain Bright Spot in Global \b  \highlight22Economy\b0 \highlight22 }}}\par \par \uc2 According to Airlangga, the court\u8217\'20\'19s decision on the law has influenced the behavior of businesses, both at home and abroad. The government has set the 2023 state \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  to below 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), meaning it would have to rely on investment.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia aims to attract Rp 1,200 trillion ($77.1 million) in total investment this year. The Southeast Asian country has raised the target to Rp 1,400 trillion in 2023 \u8212\'20\'14 something that Airlangga said to be \u8220\'20\'1Cchallenging\u8221\'20\'1D because the government usually aimed for around Rp 900 trillion.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBusinesses are in \u8216\'20\'18wait and see\u8217\'20\'19 mode for legal \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the developments of the job creation law,\u8221\'20\'1D Airlangga said.\par \par \uc2 President Jokowi has already informed House Speaker Puan Maharani concerning the latest development, according to Airlangga.\par \par \uc2 The minister said that the emergency \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  has accommodated the labor union\u8217\'20\'19s demands, particularly on outsourcing.\par \par \uc2 Previously, companies could only outsource certain types of work, namely cleaning services, worker catering services, security guard, mining and oil industry support, as well as employee transportation. But then the Omnibus Law deleted the \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  on what type of work could be outsourced, sparking labor unions' fury.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe labor union demanded that outsourcing is only limited to certain sectors, and so we did that. Previously, outsourcing was open for all sectors,\u8221\'20\'1D Airlangga said.\par \par \uc2 "We will include the [applicable] sectors [for outsourcing] on a government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he said\par \par \uc2 Document JGLOBE0020221230eicu00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Indonesia's 2023 GDP outlook dims as global trade lags\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 879 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Multiple global institutions have downgraded their expectations for Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2023 as demand from major trade partners appears set to remain low.\par \par \uc2 In the DecemberIndonesia \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Prospect(IEP) report, the \uc2 World Bank\uc2  cut Indonesia's 2023 \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth outlook to 4.8 percent from its September prediction of 5.0 percent. It also estimated that the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  had grown 5.2 percent in 2022.\par \par \uc2 While the institution noted that Indonesia's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  would likely see sustained growth over the next few years, that growth would be "softening" in the short term.\par \par \uc2 "They're growing, but at a slower pace than before," \uc2 World Bank\uc2  senior economist Wael Mansour said.\par \par \uc2 Household consumption, which represented 50.38 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2022, was expected to remain depressed by inflationary pressures this year and grow 4.6 percent, down from the 5.0 percent estimated in 2022.\par \par \uc2 The institution expected the country's inflation rate to be around 4.5 percent in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Government efforts to limit the \b \highlight22\uc2 budget deficit\b0 \highlight\uc2  to 3 percent of GDP this year would also constrain \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  interventions intended to boost purchasing power, Mansour said.\par \par \uc2 Global commodity prices, meanwhile, were expected to reduce their "trickle-down" effects on the nation's trade performance.\par \par \uc2 Domestic investment, on the other hand, was expected to find new avenues this year as a result of the recent passage of the Financial Sector Law, which supplements the previous Job Creation Law, which sought to facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI).\par \par \uc2 Mansour predicted that domestic consumption would account for 4.7 percentage points of GDP growth in 2023. Growth beyond that number would be supported by other aspects, in particular trade and investment.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 World Bank\uc2  estimated gross fixed capital formation would grow by 5.5 percent in 2023, higher than last year's projection of 4.6 percent.\par \par \uc2 "The times where Indonesia managed to record high levels of growth--7, 8 or 9 percent--was when the investment component contributed to this growth," Mansour continued.\par \par \uc2 World \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Timor-Leste lead economist Habib Rab said the projected recovery of the Chinese \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023 would result in increased demand for Indonesian natural resources.\par \par \uc2 He expected import demand would maintain its growth thanks to strong domestic consumption and that it could increase further if investment kept increasing. However, the lower global aggregate demand projected this year would likely reduce Indonesia's exports of manufactured and non-commodity goods.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 World Bank\uc2  estimates export and import growth to both moderate to 11 percent in 2023, lower than the 17 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, projected for 2022.\par \par \uc2 "Coal prices are above $300 per tonne, whenhistorically, they've been less than $100 per tonne, so that should support some of the exports going forward," Rab said.\par \par \uc2 Worsening headwinds\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Asian Development Bank\uc2  (ADB) also cut Indonesia's 2023 GDP growth projection to 4.8 percent from its previous estimate of 5.0 percent.\par \par \uc2 The 2023 number was lower than the 5.4 percent growth projected for 2022 as "worsening headwinds" were expected to continue this year due to slower demand from advanced economies.\par \par \uc2 Average inflation was revised down slightly to 5.0 percent from 5.1 percent, remaining above \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2 's target of 2 to 4 percent and higher than the estimated 4.2 percent in 2022, due to below-potential output, ample food supply and steady inflation expectations.\par \par \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 , meanwhile, expected Indonesia's 2023 growth to be 4.8 percent, down from the 5.2 percent forecast in 2022, resulting from a sluggish domestic consumption rebound, higher \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  and lower commodity prices.\par \par \uc2 The ratings agency saw "upside" potential in the tourism recovery and \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the period leading up to the general elections in early 2024.\par \par \uc2 "Infrastructure \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  is likely to continue under the next administration, including on the construction of the new capital in East Kalimantan, although the next president may have different priorities," \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  stated in its December report.\par \par \uc2 In response to these forecasts, Finance Minister \uc2 Sri Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  noted that the government had maintained its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth forecast of 5.3 percent for 2023.\par \par \uc2 If there were indications of deviation from the government projection, she said, policymakers would assess the impact on state revenue and \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "As the state's financial manager, we will continue to anticipate and be aware of changes in the global and domestic environment," the minister said on Dec. 20.\par \par \uc2 The ministry's \b \highlight22\uc2 Fiscal Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency (BKF) head Febrio Kacaribu said the government would prepare for the impact of changes in the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  and that Indonesia's growth potential "remained very strong" compared to other countries since it had lower risks of capital outflow.\par \par \uc2 "Even though \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  is higher in 2023, our \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  performance will still be above the global average," Febrio told reporters.\par \par \uc2 BKF macroeconomics \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  head Abdurohman added that \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth might not reach 5.3 percent in 2023, although it might still be above 5 percent.\par \par \uc2 He said global manufacturing and services purchasing managers' indices had already entered contraction territory in its latest data and global \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  were likely to remain high.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230101ej110000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Reimagining the ASEAN Community post-COVID\b0\par\par\uc2 1,266 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Dato Lim Jock Hoi, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 ASEAN has recovered gradually from what seems to be the most severe phase of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, but the region remains at a critical moment. New shocks have emerged and are challenging the region--the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown, higher food and energy prices, climate disasters and continued global trade tensions. But similar to managing the pandemic, the same resilience can help counter the possible far-reaching damage of such global shocks.\par \par \uc2 The region's \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  space, built over the years of successfully navigating the previous \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crises, will ensure that both monetary and \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies remain responsive and flexible to deal with the spill-overs, including implementing stronger policies to protect the poor and alleviate the impact on sectors adversely affected by the shocks.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, ASEAN's strong commitment to regional cooperation and integration will help the region navigate through these headwinds and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It also makes the ASEAN community resilient and strong despite the odds and challenges.\par \par \uc2 The region's solid achievements over the last five years attest to this.\par \par \uc2 Progress has been achieved in implementing the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework as an exit strategy from the pandemic. ASEAN's projected growth of 5.3 percent in 2022 far exceeds the global growth average of 3.2 percent. It is now crucial to build on this momentum toward an inclusive and sustainable post-pandemic recovery.\par \par \uc2 The entry into force of the \uc2 Regional Comprehensive \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Partnership\uc2  (\uc2 RCEP\uc2 ) Agreement, as well as efforts in substantially concluding the upgrade negotiations of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), upgrading the existing ASEAN FTAs, such as that for China and India, and negotiating new ones, such that with Canada, are clear reminders that ASEAN must adhere to a rules-based multilateral trading system if the region's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  dynamism is to be sustained.\par \par \uc2 Efforts to build back better and secure the contribution of regional integration for the peoples of ASEAN have continued to gain ground. ASEAN member states have managed to reopen schools, and new guidelines are now in place to keep them open for safe in-person education during health crises and emergencies in the long term.\par \par \uc2 Various programs and initiatives have been and are being implemented to empower youth, women and other vulnerable groups, including the ASEAN Regional Plan of Action on Women, Peace and Security (WPS) that was adopted at the recent ASEAN Summit in November. A case in point is the ASEAN Junior Fellowship Programme with the ASEAN Secretariat (AJFP), initiated by Brunei Darussalam, to harness the potential contribution of ASEAN's young diplomats in community-building efforts.\par \par \uc2 Mechanisms are also now in place to deal with future health crises such as the ASEAN Centre for \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases and the ASEAN Regional Reserve of Medical \b \highlight22\uc2 Public\b0 \highlight\uc2  Health Emergencies.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, amid the increasing geopolitical tensions in the world, ASEAN's commitment to peace and stability in the region has not wavered. This is underlined by ASEAN's expansion of its external relations whereby in the past five years, ASEAN enlarged its list of partners with the additions of one dialogue partner (the United Kingdom), two sectoral dialogue partners (Brazil and the United Arab Emirates) and three development partners (Chile, France and Italy). Furthermore, since 2018, 15 new High Contracting Parties, including most recently Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Oman, Qatar, Ukraine and the UAE, have acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in the Southeast Asia (TAC).\par \par \uc2 Therefore, openness and engagement remain key, as issues that challenge the security of the region are being addressed, whether in confronting radicalization and violent extremism, combating transnational crime, or making ASEAN as politically relevant as possible.\par \par \uc2 In these \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  times, the need to walk the political talk is crucial. Thus, the decision to welcome Timor-Leste as a member is not only a test of ASEAN's maturity as a security community, but also signifies that ASEAN centrality and ASEAN community are indeed working.\par \par \uc2 Yet, despite the achievements of the last five years, the ASEAN community continues to remain at the crossroads. This is because of the global and regional headwinds that impact the future of the ASEAN community, including problems like global trade tensions, climate change, digital divide and even the pandemic. Taken together, these challenges have exposed gaps or weaknesses in the ability of ASEAN to address some its goals such as participation in global value chains, enhancement of macro-financial coordination and narrowing the development gaps.\par \par \uc2 Given the multitude of changes that have impacted the underpinnings of the ASEAN community, the post-2025 ASEAN agenda should adopt a different approach to regional integration, namely one that is more dynamic and is capable of launching new initiatives and implementing measures in response to changing market and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions.\par \par \uc2 Simply put, the post-2025 agenda for ASEAN is about re-imagining the ASEAN community by identifying and implementing the right levers of regional cooperation and integration that could position ASEAN economies well in the years to come.\par \par \uc2 For example, pursuing digital transformation is clearly an imperative for a resilient future. Current efforts to accelerate the shift to a digital and knowledge \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the region, such as the Bandar Seri Begawan Roadmap on an ASEAN Digital Transformation Agenda and the development of an ASEAN Digital \b \highlight22\uc2 Economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Framework, which can drive productivity and prosperity in ASEAN in the coming years are vital.\par \par \uc2 But more is needed. There is a need to invest in infrastructure, education, cybersecurity and safety nets, and reforms to boost access to technology. More important, a new mindset is needed to ensure that everyone in ASEAN, from governments to individuals and businesses, fully and holistically embraces the digital transformation, and is ready for a digital era.\par \par \uc2 While the path ahead for ASEAN can likely be as tough, if not tougher, with the right choices, the region can overcome the worst outcomes. So, what should ASEAN do?\par \par \uc2 First, ASEAN must continue to remain relevant, dynamic and flexible. This means having strong institutions, processes and mechanisms to sustain the relevance of ASEAN as an important regional player. Endeavoring toward a strengthened and well-resourced ASEAN Secretariat is the right step forward, and the time to do it is now.\par \par \uc2 Second, the ASEAN community should and must work if ASEAN is to become the fifth-largest \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the world by 2030 as projected. The opportunities are tremendous. Unfortunately, ASEAN has a narrow path to walk toward an integrated community, and there is no room for missteps. Thus, developing a comprehensive post-2025 agenda for the ASEAN community, as well as coordinated strategies among the three community pillars is crucial. The post-2025 agenda should not be seen only as a continuation of past integration efforts, but rather, as an opportunity to re-imagine ASEAN as a truly integrated community.\par \par \uc2 Finally, since its founding, ASEAN has ensured that the welfare of the peoples should be at the center of everything. ASEAN has always adapted to a changing world. Thus, the narrowing of development gaps should not only be an initiative, rather it should be an integral part of ASEAN thinking and strategy that is embedded in every country's political, \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and social systems.\par \par \uc2 Given what the ASEAN community has accomplished over the last five years, the coming years will see the emergence of a more resilient ASEAN community, much more integrated, and better prepared to cope with shocks and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 . But to achieve that, ASEAN must continue to transform and reimagine itself.\par \par \uc2 ___________________\par \par \uc2 ASEAN secretary-general (2018-2022)\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230101ej1100004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 DPD Member Links Job Creation Perppu to Jokowi's Impeachment\b0\par\par\uc2 573 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 January 2023\par \uc2 Tempo.co\par \uc2 TEMPOE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2023. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Member of the Central Sulawesi Regional Representatives Council (DPD) Abdul Rachman Thaha on Tuesday said the issuance of the government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law (Perppu) on Job Creation (Cipta Kerja) can lead to the impeachment of President Joko \u8220\'20\'1CJokowi\u8221\'20\'1D Widodo.\par \par \uc2 He argued that the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law on Job Creation was formulated by ignoring the precautionary principle, objective interests, \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  involvement, and responsible rationalization of the Constitutional Court (MK) verdict.\par \par \uc2 Back on November 25, 2021, the Constitutional Court deemed Law No.11/2020 on Job Creation conditionally unconstitutional under the MK verdict No 91/PUU-XVIII/2020. The MK court also urged the government to fix the Job Creation law within a maximum of 2 years.\par \par \uc2 "With the conditions for impeachment, if there is a constitutional violation, of course, impeachment can be executed," Abdul told Tempo, Monday, January 2.\par \par \uc2 Impeachment against the President is contained under the 1945 Constitution articles 7A-7C. This rule states that the President and Vice President can be dismissed by the MPR on the recommendation of the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR) if they are proven to have violated the law in the form of treason against the state, corruption, bribery, other serious crimes, or disgraceful acts or if they are proven to no longer fulfill the requirements as President and/or Vice President.\par \par \uc2 According to Abdul, the issuance of the Job Creation Perppu shows actual signs of authoritarianism in \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  packaging. He also believes the issuance of this law to be an act of recklessness and endangers Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s legal environment, which signals \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and democratic crises.\par \par \uc2 According to him, House legislators should immediately end their recess period to review the impeachment of the President. However, Abdul doubts if the DPR has enough courage to impeach the President considering the abundance of the government coalition within the House.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Abdul lamented that the authority of the DPD has been deliberately weakened. He, himself would initiate such an impeachment if the DPD had more authority, Abdul asserted.\par \par \uc2 "If the DPD had more authority, believe me, I, Abdul Rachman Thaha, would take the impeachment initiative," he said.\par \par \uc2 Due to this reason, Abdul advises all DPD leaders to pay a visit to the President\u8217\'20\'19s Palace to warn the President about the bad precedent from the issuance of the Job Creation Perppu.\par \par \uc2 "The president must carry out the Constitutional Court's decision in substantive and responsible steps," he said.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi previously responded to various criticisms of the issuance of the Perppu on Job Creation. He emphasized that this government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law was issued due to the risks of global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "[The Perppu issuance] to provide legal certainty, the legal vacuum that is in the perception of internal and external investors. That is actually the most important thing," Jokowi said.\par \par \uc2 For the umpteenth time, the President mentioned that 14 countries have become patients of the \uc2 IMF\uc2 , and 28 more countries lining up to become \uc2 IMF\uc2  patients. "In fact, the world is not doing well," Jokowi asserted.\par \par \uc2 This fear of global financial \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  is what later became Jokowi's reason for issuing the Job Creation Perppu. "Because our \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023 is highly dependent on investment and exports," he said.\par \par \uc2 IMA DINI SHAFIRA\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo in Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/12/30/id_1169549/1169549_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020230102ej12000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  casually responded to the polemic that stemmed from the issuance of Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Lieu of Law or Perppu No. 2 of 2022 concerning Job Creation. The issuance of the Perppu, has drawn criticism as Jokwi was considered to have disdained the Constitutional Court's ruling.\par \par \uc2 "Yes, it's common. Pros and cons in every \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and every time a \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is issued, are common. But we can explain everything," Jokowi said during a visit to Tanah Abang Market on Monday, January 2, 2022.\par \par \uc2 On November 25, 2021, the Constitutional Court ruled that Law No. 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation was conditionally unconstitutional. The government through Constitutional Court's verdict No. 91/PUU-XVIII/2020 was ordered to amend it within 2 years.\par \par \uc2 Instead of amending the law, president Jokowi issued the Perppu on December 30, 2022, based on urgency to anticipate the threat of an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis.\par \par \uc2 The decision was criticized by many parties. Former Deputy Minister of Law and Human Rights Denny Indrayana assessed that the president had conducted Contempt of the Constitutional Court. "The president has disrespected the decisions and institutions of the Constitutional Court," Denny argued.\par \par \uc2 Regarding the urgency, Jokowi claimed that the Perppu was issued because of the risks of global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The current condition seems normal but Indonesia is under threat. "Because our \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023 is highly dependent on investment and exports," Jokowi said after issuing the Perppu.\par \par \uc2 FAJAR PEBRIANTO\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo in Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/12/30/id_1169552/1169552_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020230102ej12000ma\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Business\par \b \uc2 Indonesian Capital Market Ends 2022 on High Note: OJK\b0\par\par\uc2 411 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Globe\par \uc2 JGLOBE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2023.

The Financial Services Authority or OJK recently announced that the Indonesian capital market wrapped up 2022 on a high note, doing much better than other markets such as Europe and other ASEAN economies.\par \par \uc2 OJK chairman Mahendra Siregar cited media reports that the European stock market has just had a brutal year marked by the Russia-Ukraine. European stocks also logged their worst annual performance since 2018. This struck a huge contrast to what is happening in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe should be grateful.

Domestic investors account for 55 percent of the total investors in Indonesia. OJK revealed 58.7 percent of the total investors in Indonesia were millennials and Gen Z.\par \par \uc2 "Going forward, we have to prioritize improving our integrity, accountability, and credibility. By doing so, we will be able to 'fill the empty glass' because 10.3 million investors is merely 4 percent of our population. [...] We are also still falling behind other ASEAN economies, whose market cap has topped a hundred percent [of their GDP],\u8221\'20\'1D Mahendra said.\par \par \uc2 For reference, the \uc2 World Bank\uc2  data showed that Indonesia was home to about 273.7 million people as of 2021.\par \par \uc2 "There is no such thing as 'wait and see' when it comes to investing in Indonesia. It is all about investment, investment, and investment," Mahendra said.\par \par \uc2 Document JGLOBE0020230102ej1200002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Parties question rationale for Perppu replacing jobs law\b0\par\par\uc2 Fikri Harish, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 778 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Two opposition parties in the \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the Democratic Party and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), have criticized the controversial issuance of a government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law (Perppu) on job creation and the government's reasoning behind the decision.\par \par \uc2 "Perppu No. 2/2022 is a constitutional disaster, as it could hurt our democracy and undermine the hierarchy of the law in this country," Ledia Hanifa Amaliah, the secretary of the PKS faction at the House, said in a written statement.\par \par \uc2 The Perppu, signed by President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  on Friday, is meant to replace the Jobs Creation Law, which had been declared "conditionally unconstitutional" by the Constitutional Court (MK) in late 2021. The court gave the government and the House until November 2023 to redo the lawmaking process of the jobs law, but Ledia accused the government of ignoring legal hierarchy and the need for \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  participation by issuing the Perppu.\par \par \uc2 The Perppu must be passed by the House by the end of its next session to become permanent \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In announcing the issuance of the Perppu on Friday, Coordinating \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2  cited the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as one of the reasons behind the government's urgency "to anticipate the threat of global recession, rising inflation and the possibility of stagflation".\par \par \uc2 But Democratic Party politician Herzaky Mahendra Putra questioned this reasoning as it contradicted earlier statements made by the government regarding the country's \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The government has repeatedly bragged about its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  achievements in the last two quarters. [...] It has even allocated trillions of rupiah for huge projects like the Nusantara Capital City [IKN] and the Jakarta-Bandung high speed train," Herzaky told The Jakarta Post on Monday.\par \par \uc2 He further said that while there was indeed a crisis brewing and an urgent situation that needed to be addressed, the crisis was not the conflict in Ukraine, but the signing of the new Perppu.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia recorded a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of above 5 percent throughout 2022, and, citing the country's improving COVID-19 situation, Airlangga said early in December that he was positive Indonesia would be able to continue the trend into next year, projecting a GDP growth rate of 5.3 percent for 2023.\par \par \uc2 "Perppu No. 2/2022 is a constitutional disaster, as it could hurt our democracy and undermine the hierarchy of the law in this country."\par \par \uc2 Mixed reception\par \par \uc2 Contrary to the Democratic Party and PKS, the Golkar Party, which is part of the government coalition and whose chairman is Coordinating \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister Airlangga, firmly supports the government's decision.\par \par \uc2 "The government's decision to issue this Perppu is correct. The \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  and business actors need the legal certainty after the MK declared the previous Jobs Creation Law [unconstitutional]," Golkar lawmaker Ace Hasan said.\par \par \uc2 He reasoned that with the current global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , markets needed some assurance in the form of \b \highlight22\uc2 legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  before they could contribute to Indonesia's post-pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Member of \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  Commission IX overseeing financial affairs, Saleh Daulay from the National Mandate Party (PAN), also part of the government coalition, was more reserved in his assessment, saying that the House needed more time to dig into the thousand-page Perppu. But he acknowledged that the government had some explaining to do regarding the new \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Regarding the urgency of the Perppu, the government has an obligation to inform the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 . [...] I've also heard that the Perppu was issued to circumvent MK's decision on the Jobs Creation Law. Is this true? Again, this is something the government has to address," said Saleh.\par \par \uc2 While the House's response has mostly broken along party lines, civil society groups have been more pointed in their criticism since the Perppu was issued on Friday. Aside from how the Perppu seemed to come out of the blue, they have also zeroed in on provisions that they deem to be unfavorable to workers' interests.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions (KSPI) chairman Said Iqbal, who is also the chairman of the Labor Party, a newcomer party in the 2024 \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  election, said in a press release that he found many problems regarding the minimum wage in the new Perppu.\par \par \uc2 "Firstly, governors now are not legally required to set the minimum wage [in their provinces]. Secondly, we also reject using certain parameters to set the minimum wage increase instead of using the inflation rate and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth," he said. "We also refuse to allow the government to change the formula for the minimum wage increase and to drop the sectoral minimum wage."\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230102ej1200005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Indonesian Workers Union Association (Aspek) on Monday once again asserted its position against the government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law on Job Creation (Perppu Cipta Kerja) No.2/2022, which will effectively replace the publicly criticized Job Creation Law.\par \par \uc2 The Perppu issued by President Joko \u8220\'20\'1CJokowi\u8221\'20\'1D Widodo on December 30th, 2022, was announced by \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Affairs Coordinating Minister \uc2 Airlangga Hartarto\uc2 . The Minister elaborated that it was crucial to answering global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and geopolitical \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Aspek president Mirah Sumirat says that both the government and \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR) had failed to answer the Constitutional Court (MK) verdict which deemed the Job Creation law \u8216\'20\'18legally flawed.\u8217\'20\'19 MK initially required the government and legislators to implement fixes to the Cipta Kerja within two years, but instead issued a \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a ruse to impose the interests of investors,\u8221\'20\'1D Sumirat wrote in a statement on January 2.\par \par \uc2 Aspek officially demands the government revoke the Perppu and urged the government to replace a Perppu that would annul the Job Creation Omnibus and reinstate the law that preceded it. The workers union association argues this is crucial to guarantee Indonesians\u8217\'20\'19 right to welfare and legal certainty.\par \par \uc2 In studying the content of the government\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law, Mirah said the draft only contained a copy-paste of the Job Creation Law that had been widely criticized by members of the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEven though there are editorial differences, its content has turned even more unclear and there were no fixes, in terms of what workers' unions had demanded,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mirah Sumirat.\par \par \uc2 RIANI SANUSI PUTRI\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/12/20/id_1166829/1166829_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020230103ej130002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  (DPR) \b \highlight22\uc2 Legislation\b0 \highlight\uc2  Body (Baleg) deputy chairperson Achmad Baidowi on Monday confirmed that members of the House will discuss the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law on Job Creation (Perppu Cipta Kerja) once recess ends on January 10th. The Perppu was issued by President Joko \u8220\'20\'1CJokowi\u8221\'20\'1D Widodo on December 30th, 2022, as an answer to global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and geopolitical \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law has not been discussed by the DPR as it had just been issued by the government. The Job Creation Perppu will be discussed in the upcoming parliamentary session,\u8221\'20\'1D said Baidowi on January 2.\par \par \uc2 He then cited Law No.13/2022 on the changes of Law No.12/2011 which oversees the formulation of a law that specifically mentions a Perppu issuance must be discussed at the DPR. Article 52 (3) of the same law states that House legislators can only give consent or disapproval of government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of a law.\par \par \uc2 DPR Cannot Change a Perppu\u8217\'20\'19s Substance\par \par \uc2 Baidowi asserted that members of the House can only accept or disapprove of a Perppu and are not authorized to change its substance. However, he elaborated that the copy of the Job Creation Perppu has not been officially sent by the government to DPR.\par \par \uc2 "If the contents are the same, the most important thing is based on the government's statement that improvements are only related to technical matters such as periods, commas, and writing errors that are corrected," he said.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the urgency behind the issuance of the government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the House member said it is based on the government\u8217\'20\'19s perspective and subjectivity.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi previously responded to various criticisms of the issuance of the Perppu on Job Creation. He emphasized that this government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law was issued due to the risks of global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "[The Perppu issuance] to provide legal certainty, the legal vacuum that is in the perception of internal and external investors. That is actually the most important thing," Jokowi said.\par \par \uc2 For the umpteenth time, the President mentioned that 14 countries have become patients of the \uc2 IMF\uc2 , and 28 more countries lining up to become \uc2 IMF\uc2  patients. "In fact, the world is not doing well," Jokowi asserted.\par \par \uc2 This fear of global financial \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  is what later became Jokowi's reason for issuing the Job Creation Perppu. "Because our \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023 is highly dependent on investment and exports," he said.\par \par \uc2 ANTARA | IMA DINI SHAFIRA\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/02/09/id_1086938/1086938_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020230103ej130002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Economist Argues Job Creation Perppu Creates  \highlight22\uc2 Policy Uncertainty \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 464 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 January 2023\par \uc2 Tempo.co\par \uc2 TEMPOE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2023. PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Center of \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Law Studies (CELIOS) economist Bhima Yudhistira believes that the issuance of the government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law on Job Creation (Perppu Cipta Kerja) will only pave the way to \b \highlight22\uc2 policy uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He argues that the main issue of competitiveness is the high level of \b \highlight22\uc2 policy uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  that would create doubt among investors regarding ever-changing rules. Yudhistira argues that there are no guarantees that investments will increase after the Perppu is issued.\par \par \uc2 "In fact, investors need long-term regulatory certainty. Ideally, when making regulatory products, let alone laws, they must be prepared carefully. It will only become a problem if you rush it," said Bhima in a written statement to Tempo on Tuesday, January 3. "There is no guarantee that after the Job Creation Perppu investment will increase because so far many Job Creation derivatives have been in effect, but the number of stalled investments remains high."\par \par \uc2 Bhima also highlighted investors' doubts about increasing investment ahead of Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s political year. He said the presence of the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law actually confirms the perception that ahead of the election, \b \highlight22\uc2 policy uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  remains quite high.\par \par \uc2 "That, for investors, is a big regulatory risk," said Bhima.\par \par \uc2 He questioned one of the Articles in the Perppu which can have the most impact on the environment and investors alike, Article 128 A where the government provides a 0 percent royalty for coal utilization.\par \par \uc2 Bhima believes this will have a negative impact on the renewable energy sector because the use of coal remains massive and will threaten to shrink the portion of EBT or New and Renewable Energy.\par \par \uc2 "The government contradicts the energy transition acceleration [discussed] at the G20 forum in Bali, causing confusion from potential investors who want to enter," he explained.\par \par \uc2 As reported on Monday, President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  casually responded to the polemic that stemmed from the issuance of Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Lieu of Law (Perppu) on Job Creation. The issuance has drawn criticism.\par \par \uc2 "Yes, it's common. Pros and cons in every \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and every time a \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is issued, are common. But we can explain everything," Jokowi said during a visit to Tanah Abang Market on Monday, January 2, 2022.\par \par \uc2 On November 25, 2021, the Constitutional Court ruled that Law No.11/2020 concerning Job Creation was conditionally unconstitutional. The government through Constitutional Court's verdict No. 91/PUU-XVIII/2020 was ordered to amend it within 2 years.\par \par \uc2 Instead of amending the law, president Jokowi issued the Perppu on December 30, 2022, based on urgency to anticipate the threat of an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis.\par \par \uc2 AMELIA RAHIMA SARI\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/09/12/id_1140284/1140284_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020230103ej13000b6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

\par\par \b  \highlight22\uc2 Uncertainties \highlight\uc2  loom as political contest heats up in 2023\b0\par\par\uc2 Fikri Harish and Yerica Lai, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 863 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia is bracing for a tumultuous political year in 2023 as parties gear up for the upcoming general elections next year, raising fears of heightened \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  that analysts say could derail the nation's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Voters are expected to choose a new president in 2024, with President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Political parties, however, have until Nov. 25 to decide which candidates they will endorse to replace Jokowi, during which party elites are expected to engage in a political tug of war and horse-trading in their attempts to build alliances for the electoral contest.\par \par \uc2 Most parties in the ruling coalition have yet to nominate their presidential candidates, while those which have are still leaving the door open for changes.\par \par \uc2 The Gerindra Party and the National Awakening Party (PKB) have officially nominated Defense Minister \uc2 Prabowo Subianto\uc2  as their presidential candidate, but it is unclear if the political alliance will last until the last day of presidential-election registration. Gerindra has left open the possibility of pairing Prabowo with non-PKB candidates.\par \par \uc2 The NasDem Party, meanwhile, has declared former Jakarta governor and opposition figure \uc2 Anies Baswedan\uc2  as its presidential nominee, a political move that may cost it several Cabinet seats. The party is now seeking to build an alliance with the opposition parties, the Democratic Party and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), to be able to field Anies, which is contingent on their choice of his running mate.\par \par \uc2 The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and the Golkar Party, the largest parties in the ruling coalition, have yet to announce their presidential nominees. They have expressed their intention to endorse either Prabowo, Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo or \b \highlight22\uc2 House of Representatives\b0 \highlight\uc2  Speaker Puan Maharani.\par \par \uc2 Intra-elite conflicts\par \par \uc2 Political analyst Adi Prayitno of the Syarif Hidayatullah Islamic State University (UIN) expects that the political situation in 2023 will only heat up as there were already signs of conflict in 2022.\par \par \uc2 "Elites from the PDI-P and NasDem have started to openly engage in conflict, with the PDI-P asking NasDem to exit from the coalition and hoping that the President will remove NasDem ministers from the Cabinet", said Adi.\par \par \uc2 While NasDem was originally part of the government coalition led by the PDI-P, the party has since broken ranks by backing Anies. President Jokowi has already signaled an impending Cabinet reshuffle, fueling speculation that he will finally show the door to Cabinet members from NasDem.\par \par \uc2 The intra-elite conflict, however, goes beyond the PDI-P-NasDem rivalry.\par \par \uc2 Tensions are reportedly brewing between President Jokowi and PDI-P chairwoman \uc2 Megawati Soekarnoputri\uc2  over the question of who the party will endorse for 2024. The President has insinuated his preference for his fellow PDI-P member Ganjar as his potential successor, while Megawati seems hesitant to lend her support for the Central Java governor despite his high electability rates. Ganjar is reportedly competing with Puan and Prabowo for Megawati's blessing and thus the PDI-P nomination.\par \par \uc2 While the elites squabble over presidential nominations, the online community has become increasingly divided over the two most popular candidates according to political pollsters: Anies and Ganjar.\par \par \uc2 Adi, however, sees this kind of polarization, particularly on social media, as expected in an electoral democracy. "What's important is how to avoid narratives based on lies, hate and enmity. As long as the competition is based on their [merit], it's fine", he said.\par \par \uc2 He further added that the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  tended to be rational and more politically aware, so even if political buzzers continue to try and sow division on social media, Adi expects that it will not bleed into real life.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Uncertainties\b0 \highlight\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  in an election year will undoubtedly have an impact on the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially regarding investments according to Center of Reform on Economics (CORE) Indonesia executive director Mohammad Faisal.\par \par \uc2 "In the year approaching an election, businesses will hold off on any major decisions until there's clarity on who the next president is", said Faisal. But the effect will not be identical, with Faisal saying that certain long-term investments, especially those away from population centers such as mining and smelters, will not be affected much by the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Institute for Development Economics and Finance (Indef) director Tauhid Ahmad concurred, saying that \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  in a political year, whether regarding the candidates or among the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2 , will prompt market players to hold off on any investment or business decisions. "The market is wary of heightened \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , not to mention the current global situation and inflation," said Tauhid.\par \par \uc2 The next administration's \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  policies, potential conflict among the \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  in a political year and how the market views each candidate are some questions that will weigh on investors' minds according to Tauhid.\par \par \uc2 With party elites jostling each other for the nation's top job, it is likely that the presidential election will set the political temperature in 2023. "They're pretty chill about the \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  elections. But when it comes to the presidential election, [the parties] are very much open for a political brawl."

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly said \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  criticism against the government \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lieu of law or Perppu on job creation was normal. He asserted that a \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  cannot fulfill 100 percent of people's aspirations.\par \par \uc2 However, he claimed the government exercised efforts to listen to the people right after the Constitutional Court declared the Job Creation Law unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo we have input, there have been changes, especially in the workforce,\u8221\'20\'1D said Yasonna on Wednesday, January 4, 2022.\par \par \uc2 Yasonna also said the ratification of the Perppu was based on an analysis of global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions. For this reason, he said the Perppu was aimed at tackling future global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEconomists [predict that the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2 ] conditions in 2023 will not be good. The prognosis could be a global recession and others,\u8221\'20\'1D he said when met at the ministry\u8217\'20\'19s building, South Jakarta.\par \par \uc2 The government hoped that the Perppu would be an effort to recover from the global recession. With this \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , he said MSMEs would be more resilient to global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is our effort to facilitate the ease of doing business, supporting MSMEs so that in 2023, the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions will be better,\u8221\'20\'1D said the PDI-P politician.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, Yasonna said this Perppu had been discussed for a long time since the Constitutional Court's verdict was issued. The law determination, however, was in accordance with the applicable regulations, including the court's ruling.\par \par \uc2 MIRZA BAGASKARA\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/12/16/id_1165836/1165836_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020230104ej14000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Modest loan growth could be a drag on banking sector in 2023\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 845 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Modest loan growth is projected for Indonesia in 2023 in contrast to last year's surge in credit growth, as lenders and borrowers are likely to face tougher conditions stemming from looming global and local \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Experts toldThe Jakarta Postthat this year would be challenging for both banks and borrowers as the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  weakened and the commodities boom subsided. At the same time, many central banks, including \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI)\uc2 , were expected to follow the interest rate hikes of the \uc2 United States Federal Reserve\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Domestic industries with high reliance on exports were certain to see muted growth, but all sectors were likely to feel the pain from high \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  that caused an increase in borrowing as well as input costs, partly due to prolonged supply chain disruptions and rupiah depreciation.\par \par \uc2 Tengfu Li, financial institutions analyst at \uc2 Moody's\uc2  Investors Service, told a virtual press briefing on Dec. 7 that banks would gradually pass on the rate hike to borrowers, which could deter loan access. However, he added that he also expected lenders to keep their rates competitive to remain attractive.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, businesses had started taking a cautious approach toward entering 2023, given the potential \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  from a relatively bleak global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook and Indonesia heading into a "political year".\par \par \uc2 "We expect loan growth to moderate to 10 percent [year-on-year/yoy]," Li said.\par \par \uc2 Li's forecast was much weaker than the yearly credit growth projection for 2022, which still hovered at around 12 percent.\par \par \uc2 It was also much lower than BI's projection of between 10 and 12 percent yoy, marking slight growth from last year's target of between 9 and 11 percent yoy.\par \par \uc2 Many experts expected weaker loan growth in 2023 compared to the previous year in line with the worsening national economicoutlook.\par \par \uc2 Ajib Hamdani, who heads the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis division at the Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo), said in November that firms might not be as keen to apply for loans in 2023, as they were anticipating prolonged high inflation and a decline in purchasing power.\par \par \uc2 Major Indonesian banks were split on what to do, despite announcing they would continue to aim for lucrative sectors that were generally resilient during a crisis, such as commodities, telecommunications and food and beverages.\par \par \uc2 State-owned lender \uc2 Bank Mandiri\uc2  said it would continue to accelerate lending in 2023, implying that it was still possible to achieve higher loan growth. Meanwhile, private lender BCA aimed to maintain its loan growth for this year, estimated at 12 percent yoy.\par \par \uc2 BRI projected a slightly lower disbursement rate than BI's 2023 target of between 9 and 11 percent yoy growth, with the state-owned lender opting for a conservative target of 9 percent relative to its 2022target of 10 percent.\par \par \uc2 BI Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  on Dec. 22 expressed confidence that increasing the \b \highlight22\uc2 central bank\b0 \highlight\uc2 's benchmark rate would not trigger a significant hike among lenders, adding that BI would ensure adequate liquidity so banks could limit increases to their lending rates.\par \par \uc2 Financial Services Authority (OJK) \uc2 chairman Mahendra Siregar saidon Dec. 21 that loan disbursements would continue to contribute to the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in 2023, implying that he expected significant loan growth following 2022's positive trend.\par \par \uc2 However, he cautioned banks not to celebrate prematurely over their high earnings and profits from 2022's performance. The \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  looming over 2023 should not be taken lightly, he stressed, and banks should make the necessary preparations to weather the impacts.\par \par \uc2 "We remind banks to strengthen their provisioning. Don't be too euphoric about your profits and then rush to distribute dividends," Mahendra said.\par \par \uc2 He also urged banks to keep a watchful eye over their exposure to vulnerable sectors, particularly those affected by market fluctuations and weakening demand.\par \par \uc2 Moody's\uc2 ' Li said he expected a slight uptick in nonperforming loans (NPL) in 2023, when the OJK would end its loan restructuring program for all sectors aside from the textile and footwear, hotels and restaurants, and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sectors.\par \par \uc2 He added that the termination of the OJK's forbearance measure would not have a significant impact, as the number of restructured loans had declined with more borrowers able to make repayments.\par \par \uc2 Historical figures also showed that NPLs tended to grow in the event of a commodity price correction, Li noted, but 2023 would be different, as prices were likely to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.\par \par \uc2 However, the outlook for the property sector was vastly different, as \uc2 Moody's\uc2  had slashed it to negative amid the ongoing trend in high \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 M. Amin Nurdin, head of consultation and assessment at the Indonesian Banking Development Institute (LPPI), said last Thursday that the banking industry was relatively well prepared for 2023, especially in terms of increasing their provisions.\par \par \uc2 He expressed optimism that, with the OJK still allowing the three selected sectors access its restructuring program for another year, this was sure to minimize the negative impact on the financial sector.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230104ej1400005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FEATURES\par \b \uc2 EXPECTING A BETTER INDONESIAN  \highlight22\uc2 ECONOMY \highlight\uc2  IN 2023\b0\par\par\uc2 893 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 January 2023\par \uc2 LKBN ANTARA\par \uc2 ANTARA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2023. LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Entering the new year, the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  condition seems to be the same as the previous years, replete with challenges and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  (\uc2 IMF\uc2 ) projected that 2023 will be a difficult year for the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as main engines of the world"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth-- the United States, China, and the euro area -- are experiencing stalling growth.\par \par \uc2 As China is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, other regions in Europe are facing geopolitical conflicts, and central banks raised their \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  to curb inflation.\par \par \uc2 Facing the risk of an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown, Indonesia has prepared itself with policies, one of which is \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  support through the 2023 State \b \highlight22\uc2 Budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  (APBN) that is considered responsive and accommodative.\par \par \uc2 On December 30, 2022, President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  officially lifted \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity restrictions (PPKM) against COVID-19 that eased \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  mobility and triggered more activities outdoors.\par \par \uc2 The PPKM \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  was lifted after observing Indonesia"s COVID-19 cases for 10 months that have been under control.\par \par \uc2 The easing of community mobility is a new factor that strengthens \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience internally because its impact can improve the performance of the service, manufacturing industry, and the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sectors.\par \par \uc2 With the PPKM revocation, the flow of goods and people"s mobility is expected to be smooth, and the undisturbed distribution of foodstuffs will stabilize prices, therefore, maintaining national inflation.\par \par \uc2 Inflation\par \par \uc2 The disrupted global food and energy supply chains due to the pandemic and geopolitical turmoil have contributed to the global increase in inflation and affected domestic conditions.\par \par \uc2 Inflation negatively impacts low-income people"s purchasing power and withdraws the recovery of long-distance mobility.\par \par \uc2 Responding to the surge in inflation, several countries have tightened their monetary policies by increasing their \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which put more pressure on the global \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This continued pressure can lead to stagflation, a combination of high inflation and \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  stagnation, and weaken the global labor market due to falling real wages and demand for credit.\par \par \uc2 In the domestic sector, there are two options to face this, either maintaining inflation with the risks of rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  or facing a potential recession by lowering the \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  to get the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  moving again.\par \par \uc2 According to Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Indonesia"s year-on-year inflation in 2022 was recorded at 5.51 percent, which was largely contributed by price movements in the transportation and foodstuffs sectors.\par \par \uc2 Finance Minister \uc2 Sri Mulyani Indrawati\uc2  said that 2023 will present several hard tests, ranging from controlling global inflation, preventing recession, and bolstering post-pandemic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery.\par \par \uc2 Indrawati stated that Indonesia cannot control the challenges that exist because it is part of its journey as a country.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot choose the challenge, (but) what we can choose is to strengthen our readiness," she affirmed.\par \par \uc2 To this end, the minister invited all stakeholders to strengthen Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience by working cooperatively, competently, professionally, and with high integrity.\par \par \uc2 Five percent\par \par \uc2 Although both global and domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions are still replete with \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , there is a ray of optimism that the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can grow 5.3 percent in 2023.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 Governor \uc2 Perry Warjiyo\uc2  projected that the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can grow in the range of 4.5 percent to 5.3 percent in 2023, supported by downstreaming, infrastructure development, foreign investment, and tourism activities.\par \par \uc2 Warjiyo explained that the projection considered the fact that Indonesia managed to survive and recover after 30 months of fighting COVID-19, as can be seen from maintained \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  stability to high \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth that was better than many countries.\par \par \uc2 The positive achievement was the result of strong synergy and innovation among stakeholders, especially \b \highlight22\uc2 fiscal\b0 \highlight\uc2  and monetary authorities, such as the government and BI.\par \par \uc2 BI will strive to suppress inflation back to normal levels, with the target of three percent, give or take one percent, in 2023 and 2.5 percent, give or take one percent, in 2024 through measured actions and policies.\par \par \uc2 Chairperson of the Indonesian Employers" Association (Apindo) Haryadi Sukamdani projected that the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  can grow in the range of five percent to 5.3 percent in 2023 or better than the average of developed countries.\par \par \uc2 Sukamdani explained the projected growth range is based on \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery that was running quite well in 2022 due to social protection and national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery (PEN) programs.\par \par \uc2 However, he noted that the impact of global recession was very real on the decline in aggregate demand for exports of labor-intensive industrial products followed by massive layoffs at the end of 2022 that are projected to continue in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Hence, to achieve the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth target in 2023, he said, the government needs to be consistent in carrying out the structural \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  reform agendas as reflected in the Job Creation Law.\par \par \uc2 "Issues of \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  inconsistency need to be addressed quickly. Policies that destroy medium-long-term structural reform must be corrected," Sukamdani said.\par \par \uc2 These various \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  projections for 2023 should become a motivation to improve better, as strengthening resilience should be conducted in line with \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  acceleration.\par \par \uc2 Thus, 2023 can be the year for Indonesia to drive the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  that was slow during the pandemic, so that Indonesia can pass the global test and not fall into the abyss of recession.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-KZU/A/A075/A075) 06-01-2023 20:09:53\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020230106ej16001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Crypto market braces for stricter  \highlight22\uc2 regulation \highlight\uc2  amid downturn\b0\par\par\uc2 Vincent Fabian Thomas, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 717 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 The Indonesian crypto market is unlikely to improve in 2023, with investors braced for another difficult year amid a new regulatory environment.\par \par \uc2 The global cryptocurrency market capitalization evaporated by more than 60 percent over the past year to around US$800 billion, CoinMarketCap data show. Several crypto exchanges have filed for bankruptcy, including the most notable exchange FTX.\par \par \uc2 In line with this bearish trend, the transaction value of crypto assets in Indonesia fell by more than 65 percent to around Rp 300 trillion ($19.1 billion) in 2022, from Rp 859 trillion the previous year, Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) data show.\par \par \uc2 Bappebti expected the value of crypto assets, especially cryptocurrencies to continue declining this year, albeit at a much slower rate, as it has already gotten close to the bottom, but the agency noted it would take quite a long time before it could make a significant rebound.\par \par \uc2 "We will continue facing extraordinary challenges in cryptocurrencies in 2023," Acting Bappebti head Didid Noordiatmoko told an audience during a briefing on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrencies had attracted massive popularity in Indonesia and many parts of the world since the pandemic began.\par \par \uc2 In Indonesia, there were more than 16.5 million cryptocurrency investors as of November last year, surpassing total investors in the capital markets, which only numbered 10 million in the same month, authorities' data show.\par \par \uc2 Bobby, secretary-general of the Association of Crypto Asset Trading Platforms (Aspakrindo), said on Wednesday that cryptocurrencies were no different from any other financial instrument that faced pressure from prolonged global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  such as rising \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the war in Ukraine, which led to investors avoiding riskier assets.\par \par \uc2 Bobby said newly introduced income \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  and value added \b \highlight22\uc2 tax\b0 \highlight\uc2  (VAT) on crypto transactions last year also exacerbated the decline in transactions, adding that the association hoped the government would readjust the rates to help the industry recover.\par \par \uc2 Stringent crypto supervision\par \par \uc2 In line with the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies in recent years, the government moved to regulate crypto assets further, especially in the newly passed omnibus Financial Sector Law last year.\par \par \uc2 The law will transfer the supervisory role of crypto assets from Bappebti to the \uc2 Financial Services Authority (OJK)\uc2 . Bappebti viewed the transfer as necessary because the crypto market had grown significantly to the point that it had started to pose a risk to the financial system.\par \par \uc2 The transition period will be two years or sooner after the government concludes a \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  to derive rules from the new law, which is slated to be finished in less than six months.\par \par \uc2 OJK chairman Mahendra Siregar told reporters on Dec. 21, 2022 that he did not want Indonesia to only be a market for crypto trading but that crypto assets should benefit the Indonesian \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  as well.\par \par \uc2 Despite the OJK having no prior experience in regulating crypto, Mahendra gave an assurance that it would prepare the necessary human resources and infrastructure to accommodate the plan.\par \par \uc2 Bappebti said that it was possible that the transfer would not simply be on paper, but also involve professionals working in the agency to help bolster the OJK's capability in supervising crypto.\par \par \uc2 The government had previously laid a plan to construct a crypto bourse to facilitate the crypto market in the country, but it has been delayed since its first completion target in 2021. Now, Bappebti aims to finish it by the end of 2023 or alternatively the OJK, as future regulator, could set it up.\par \par \uc2 The bourse would be accompanied by a clearance house and a custodian, which would help spread the risk of the crypto market from that previously borne by Bappebti alone.\par \par \uc2 Aspakrindo's Bobby said shifting the supervision of crypto to the OJK would give the industry better supervision and the industry players would work alongside regulators to ensure a smooth transition, but he hoped the move would not lead to over \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which could hamper the growth of the crypto industry in the country.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Tahir, cofounder of crypto trading software Cryptowatch, said on Wednesday that he expected the crypto industry would be supervised more strictly compared with previous \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  as the OJK did with other industries, but he urged the watchdog to allow room for innovation to grow.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230106ej1600006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 The catalyst for ASEAN's energy transition\b0\par\par\uc2 1,192 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Nuki Agya Utama and Zulfikar Yurnaidi, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 The year 2022 witnessed three summits hosted in Southeast Asia: The ASEAN Summit in Cambodia, the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  Summit in Indonesia and the \uc2 Asia-Pacific \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Cooperation (APEC) \uc2 Summit in Thailand. They discussed \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  recovery, climate action and sustainability, including accelerating the clean energy investment for energy security.\par \par \uc2 Energy security, which also took the centerpiece of 2022, is a core interest of ASEAN. With its \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth and reliance on fossil fuels, the 7th \uc2 ASEAN Energy\uc2  Outlook (AEO7) estimated ASEAN would become the net importer of natural gas and coal as soon as 2025 and 2039, respectively, if no changes happen in demand and supply.\par \par \uc2 The ASEAN Summit reiterated the implementation of the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) Phase II: 2021-2025 through the deployment of cleaner energy technologies and end-user electrification.\par \par \uc2 The G20 Summit launched the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), a US$20 billion program dedicated to decarbonizing Indonesia's power system.\par \par \uc2 The APEC Summit adopted the Bangkok Goal for the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a sustainable model to pursue advanced resource efficiency, less waste and value-creating business models.\par \par \uc2 Warmly welcomed by many, JETP aims for an investment and \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  plan to deploy ambitious renewable energy (RE) share to at least 34 percent of Indonesia's power generation mix by 2030 and to prioritize the early retirement of the coal-fired power plant. Following that, a similar commitment was made recently for Vietnam.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Bangkok's BCG \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  model promotes RE, biofuels and higher energy efficiency, which are all in line with the APAEC aspiration to have a 23 percent RE share of the total primary energy supply (TPES) by 2025.\par \par \uc2 According to the AEO7, ASEAN must fill the gap of almost 10 percent-point from the 14.2 percent RE share in 2020 to the 2025 regional target. Many member states' key strategies are utilizing solar and wind energy.\par \par \uc2 In the past five years, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia have significantly increased solar share in their national installed capacity, reaching 16.6 gigawatt, 2.8 GW and 1.5 GW respectively.\par \par \uc2 With its roles in addressing energy security and climate issues, ASEAN consistently works toward green energy ambitions through renewables.\par \par \uc2 However, the main questions persist, what would be the sensible pace and priority to achieve their target after the summit? What are the best strategies to solve the rising energy security problems amidst the mounting \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  challenges due to geopolitical conflicts and pandemics?\par \par \uc2 As the region targets more RE, especially solar and wind, more stress will be put on the electricity grid.\par \par \uc2 In addressing the intermittency while keeping the supply-demand stable, the member states should improve their grid flexibility and resiliency. Missing that and we'll see a "boom and bust" phenomenon.\par \par \uc2 The case of Vietnam could provide good lessons for ASEAN. After the rapid solar deployment in 2019, from less than 500 megawatt to 4 GW, Vietnam experienced challenging power system operations.\par \par \uc2 Since the \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  requires \uc2 Vietnam Electricity\uc2  (\uc2 EVN\uc2 ) to purchase electricity from the newly built solar farm, \uc2 EVN\uc2  is forced to curtail other RE sources, such as stopping nearly 8 GW of hydroelectricity at noon.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, lower electricity demand due to COVID-19 and the unprepared grid have amplified the difficulties in maintaining the lowest generation cost of prioritizing RE.\par \par \uc2 The long-awaited Power Development Plan VIII (PDP8) would see limited addition of new solar capacity until 2030. Instead, priority will be the wind development of 21.5 GW onshore and 7 GW offshore. In September 2022, \uc2 EVN\uc2  cut the utilization rate of its largest solar farm, the Trung Nam-Thuan Nam solar power plant, by 40 percent due to the \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  of feed-in \b \highlight22\uc2 tariff\b0 \highlight\uc2  (FIT).\par \par \uc2 Besides national grid improvement, ASEAN could benefit by accelerating its vision of the ASEAN Power Grid (APG). APG received wide attention due to the first 100 MW renewable electricity import involving four ASEAN member states from the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-\uc2 Singapore Power\uc2  Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) in June 2022.\par \par \uc2 With renewed interest in the interconnection, the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia and Philippines (BIMP) line is worth watching.\par \par \uc2 According to the ASEAN Interconnection Masterplan Study III (AIMS III), up to 21.8 GW extension of transmission capacity is required to optimize cross-border RE resource sharing in ASEAN, which requires $16,23 billion in investment, Identified as well was untapped 8,119 GW (12,000 TWh) solar potential on 42 sites and 342 GW (766 TWh) wind resources on 20 sites. Through its least cost scenario, AEO7 also showed the interconnection as key for the energy transition in the region.\par \par \uc2 AEO7 also highlighted the importance of energy storage to improve the stability of RE supply into the grid.\par \par \uc2 A 27 GW capacity is projected to smooth the load in the least cost scenario. ASEAN has been progressing through 200 MWh energy storage installation in Singapore, the 20 MWh battery energy storage system in the Philippines and the FIT introduction for solar plus storage in Thailand.\par \par \uc2 Other than lithium-ion batteries, alternatives such as sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries and pumped-up hydro should be fully explored.\par \par \uc2 While flexibility is not a new discussion topic for ASEAN, major renewables uptake and dynamic changes in electricity demand due to the electrification of end-use sectors have prompted the need for a higher level of grid flexibility.\par \par \uc2 For example, almost all ASEAN member states have introduced electric vehicle targets and incentives.\par \par \uc2 Other strategies to improve grid resiliency include residential energy storage and new grid services, such as virtual power plants, fast-response ancillary services and state-of-the-art automated systems, e.g., distributed control systems. Development such as the solar-flex grid model in Lao PDR can be a great example.\par \par \uc2 More importantly, ASEAN should focus on renewable-based baseload generation, such as hydro, geothermal and bioenergy.\par \par \uc2 Considering the smart and flexible grid is indeed complex and expensive, the high RE target implies an immense cost already. But the countries should not neglect the important catalyst, the power grid.\par \par \uc2 Moreso if they want to have a quick and smooth energy transition. Therefore, commitments such as the JETP should be realized and designed to address supporting infrastructure issues.\par \par \uc2 As demonstrated by the three important summits in the region which ended on an optimistic note, ASEAN will be part of the solution.

\par\par \b \uc2 Rowing between two reefs in fast-changing world\b0\par\par\uc2 827 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Rio Budi Rahmanto, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 In early 2022, Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi highlighted Indonesia's foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  prioritizing the recovery process, citizens' protection abroad, promotion of peace and Indonesia's leadership role in the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2 . As it turns out, 2022 was an eventful year.\par \par \uc2 COVID-19 reached its third year and the unexpected war in Ukraine led to global food and energy crises, and even financial turmoil, while geopolitical tensions deepened among the major powers.\par \par \uc2 Amid new challenges and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 , there are notable achievements in Indonesia's leadership and diplomacy.\par \par \uc2 On the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and recovery front, Indonesia's G20 presidency reached consensus with the G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration, despite strong divisions within the group. The declaration laid out commitments on concrete measures and programs to address \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and social challenges.\par \par \uc2 Capitalizing on G20 momentum, G20 members and invitees brought investment and cooperation in at least 140 bilateral projects valued at around US$71.49 billion to Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Business Forums with Latin America and the Caribbean (INA-LAC) as well as Central and Eastern Europe (INA-CEE) generated transaction and business potential worth approximately $179.1 million and $386.6 million, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia and Switzerland signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) in May 2022 to enhance business certainty and strengthen legal protection. While the Indonesia-Pacific Forum for Development (IPFD) provided a road map for long-term development cooperation with our Pacific neighbors.\par \par \uc2 In the health sector, Indonesia secured 516.85 trillion doses of vaccine until early December 2022.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility also helped to distribute 1.84 billion doses of vaccine to around 146 low and middle-income countries.\par \par \uc2 Citizens' protection abroad becomes more challenging with prolonged pandemic and new conflicts. In March 2022, for instance, Indonesia had to evacuate 133 of its citizens from Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Regarding the war in Ukraine, President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  was the first Asian leader to visit both Russia and Ukraine to advocate for a peaceful resolution of conflict, and humanitarian efforts, including overcoming supply-chain disruptions affecting food and energy crises.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia continues to support the Afghan and Palestinian peoples in their endeavors. The recent International Conference on Afghan Women's Education (ICAWE) held in Bali in November 2022, for instance, specifically supports Afghan women's education.\par \par \uc2 These results exemplify Indonesia's leadership and diplomacy in navigating through new and \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertain\b0 \highlight\uc2  challenges in 2022.\par \par \uc2 So, what lies ahead for Indonesia's diplomacy in 2023?\par \par \uc2 First, ASEAN will be the centerpiece of 2023.\par \par \uc2 From 2000-2022 ASEAN had a positive growth rate and is expected to reach around 5.0-5.3 percent growth in 2022, higher than the 3.2 percent of global growth average. It is imperative to take the momentum of ASEAN as the epicenter of growth, including implementing the \uc2 Regional Comprehensive \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  Partnership\uc2  (\uc2 RCEP\uc2 ), and ASEAN Outlook in Indo-Pacific, and to use ASEAN health crisis-related mechanisms to achieve an inclusive and sustainable post-pandemic recovery.\par \par \uc2 Political and security issues will be a sticking point; however, they must be addressed openly and constructively, including with ASEAN external partners.\par \par \uc2 In foresight, with a new member Timor Leste and deeper integration, ASEAN needs stronger institutions, processes and mechanisms.\par \par \uc2 The post-2025 ASEAN agenda will be crucial to ensure a more secure and stable region, narrow development and infrastructure gaps, as well as strengthen resilience against future shocks and crises.\par \par \uc2 Second, Indonesia will be facing continuing challenges including \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  slowdown, rising food and energy prices, as well as the climate crisis.\par \par \uc2 Global growth is estimated to reach 2.7 percent only in 2023, as against 6 percent in 2021, and the inflation rate will hit 6.5 percent in 2023, up from 4.7 percent in 2021.\par \par \uc2 Food and energy prices might decline, but sudden price shocks might cause longer inflation.\par \par \uc2 These challenges cannot be dealt with alone. Diplomacy in 2023 requires even greater coordination and collaboration at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels.\par \par \uc2 Despite those challenges, Indonesia remains a favorable place for business and investments. In 2023, growth is projected to stand between 4.7 and 5.3 percent.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia's diplomacy in 2023 should then focus on both inbound and outbound investments, opening market access including nontraditional markets, promoting energy transition and green industries, strengthening health and disaster-risk resilience, as well as optimizing digitalization and the digital market.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia should also secure foodstuffs, fertilizer and cleaner energy sources to ensure affordability for the people while continuing to constructively engage in global governance related to food and energy security.\par \par \uc2 Moving forward, Indonesia's leadership and diplomacy must remain focused on the welfare of the people, while being firm with our principle of active and independent foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Our ways must be agile and adaptive, as our forefathers described as "rowing between two reefs", in confronting today's fast-changing world.\par \par \uc2 __________________\par \par \uc2 Head of the Center for Multilateral Strategy \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \uc2 Indonesian Foreign Ministry\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230109ej190000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - The \uc2 Financial Services Authority (OJK) \uc2 has described the banking industry"s strong and stable performance in 2022 as a glimmer of hope amid global \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  turmoil.\par \par \uc2 "The OJK is optimistic that banking conditions will be maintained and will support national \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, although risks need to be watched out amid global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which could impede \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth," chief executive of banking supervision at OJKDian Ediana Raesaid in an official statement received here on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 According to the OJK, in November 2022, bank loans grew 11.16 percent year on year (yoy) while third-party funds (DPK) swelled by 8.78 percent yoy.\par \par \uc2 The growth rate of credit and third-party funds exceeded the rate recorded prior to the pandemic, with maintained banking risk indicators. Good development in banking was also reflected in ample liquidity conditions, as reflected in the LA/NCD and LA/DPK ratios of 134.97 percent and 30.42 percent, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Bank capital was also relatively strong, with a capital adequacy ratio of 25.49 percent, and was believed to be able to withstand risks. Credit risk tended to decline, as reflected in the gross and net NPL ratios of 2.65 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively, while loans at risk were capped at 15.12 percent.\par \par \uc2 "The reduction in credit risk is partly due to the improved quality of restructured credit due to the impact of COVID-19," he pointed out.\par \par \uc2 Despite the current financial system stability, he warned that banks must be cautious of risks amid the global turmoil, which could compromise \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth, such as the scarring effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased yields on commercial paper, potential depreciation of the rupiah, and decreased liquidity.\par \par \uc2 The OJK will gear future banking policies toward the improvement of banking \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and supervision as well as the development of a healthy, efficient banking industry with integrity.\par \par \uc2 "OJK will continue to improve the early warning system supported by information technology so that it can detect financial problems and other aspects earlier and take early supervisory measures before these problems drag on and become (serious)," he said.\par \par \uc2 It will also continue banking consolidation, particularly that of sharia banking, Regional Development Banks, and rural banks.\par \par \uc2 This would be pursued through the establishment of Integrated Bank Business Groups (KUB), with large banks serving as holding banks that can meet liquidity and capital needs and form synergy for developing banking products and services, improving governance and infrastructure on technology and human resources, as well as increasing the customer base.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-MCA/A/A063/A063) 10-01-2023 23:39:11\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020230110ej1a001ry\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw177\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2655\pichgoal600

PT Tempo Inti Media, Tbk \par \par \uc2 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - President \uc2 Joko Widodo\uc2  or Jokowi reminded political parties not to play on identity politics during next year's elections. He asked all parties and \b \highlight22\uc2 legislative\b0 \highlight\uc2  candidates as well as presidential candidates to focus on campaigning their ideas and plans instead.\par \par \uc2 "I have always said, don't use identity politics. Now is no longer an era for clashing identities, but a time to contest ideas, programs, and projects," the President said in his address during the national coordination meeting of the Crescent Moon Party (PBB) in North Jakarta, Wednesday, January 11.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi mentioned how the world is currently shrouded with \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  stemming from threats of recession. If Indonesia's political conditions heat up and shake the \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  stability, Jokowi fears it will be difficult to return conditions to normal.\par \par \uc2 "Again, let's win together. Thus, we must win intelligently, win politely, and if you want to win, win in friendly ways," Jokowi said.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi Supports Yusril\par \par \uc2 On the same occasion, Jokowi expressed his support for Yusril Ihza Mahendra if the latter wishes to run for president or vice president in next year's elections. According to Jokowi, Yusril is a politician with long and qualified experience.\par \par \uc2 Jokowi said that when he ran for mayor in Solo, one of the parties that backed his campaign was the PBB. During the 2019 presidential elections, PBB also supported Jokowi.\par \par \uc2 "So if I want to give my support in return, it should be fine," the president said.\par \par \uc2 M Julnis Firmansyah\par \par \uc2 Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/01/11/id_1172289/1172289_720.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here to view picture}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TEMPOE0020230111ej1b000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Retail sales stall in December despite strong consumer confidence\b0\par\par\uc2 Fadhil Haidar Sulaeman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 734 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Looming \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  has stalled retail sales, with people showing a tendency to cover their basic needs before other \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  despite Indonesian consumers remaining optimistic throughout last year thanks to maintained inflation and improved \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions.\par \par \uc2 Retail sales were projected to grow by only a miniscule amount of 0.04 percent year-on-year (yoy) to 216.4 in December, marking the lowest growth last year after the growth continued to fall since July at 6.2 percent yoy, \b \highlight22\uc2 Bank Indonesia\b0 \highlight\uc2  (BI) \uc2 data show.\par \par \uc2 On a monthly basis, however, retail sales still increased by 6.3 percent.\par \par \uc2 "Improvement was mainly seen in clothing and electronics due to high sales of digital TVs, while food and beverages are propped by Christmas, New Year's Eve and discounts that spur domestic demand," BI's spokesperson Erwin Haryono said on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The clothing category booked the highest sale, growing by 10.4 percent yoy, followed by recreational and miscellaneous goods at 4.9 percent yoy and 3.3 percent yoy, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Foods and beverages, which was supposed to have high demand following eased mobility restriction during Christmas and New Year Eve celebrations, only grew by 1.7 percent yoy.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, electronic sales grew 0.2 percent yoy in December, marking the only growth throughout last year.\par \par \uc2 Correction in household appliances sales contributed the most to suppressing retail sales growth after being downed by 14.4 percent yoy last year, followed by sales in automotive fuels and motor vehicles, which declined by 10.7 percent yoy and 9.6 percent yoy, respectively.\par \par \uc2 "Consumers are prioritizing fulfilling their primary needs, compared to secondary and tertiary needs," Center of \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Law Studies (CELIOS) executive director Bhima Yudhistira told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The miniscule sales growth in December was already dampened by the high-base effect in December 2021, when the government began to ease travel restrictions.\par \par \uc2 Even though the government implemented a no-restrictions \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in last year's December festivities, the above-target inflation and \b \highlight22\uc2 interest rates\b0 \highlight\uc2  had taken their toll on consumers' purchasing power, which lower the demand for property and durable goods.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the consumer confidence index (CCI) rose by 0.8 points to 119.9 in December, quickly rebounding after a fall in the preceding month, according to BI data.\par \par \uc2 The CCI considers \b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  opinion on personal income, employment prospects and the macroeconomic environment as things affecting propensity to spend, which in turn affects the nation's overall consumer \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "A much-improved consumers' confidence in December was propped up by the optimism about the current conditions, which shows an uptick in all of its components," BI's Erwin said in separate statement.\par \par \uc2 The current \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions subindex rose by 2.1 points to 112.4 from a month before, as consumers felt upbeat about their present income, employment opportunities and ability to purchase durable goods.\par \par \uc2 However, subindex on future expectations fell by 0.6 points to 127.3, extending the slide since November, as consumers feel less optimistic about the job market and business activities in the next six months.\par \par \uc2 Lower-income consumers, those \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  below Rp 2 million (US$128.30) a month, had a much better confidence in the \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  in December than the preceding month due to an improved job market that saw a shift from pessimistic to optimistic.\par \par \uc2 The group, however, remained cagey about purchasing durable goods, as their viewpoint continues to linger in the pessimistic arena with 95 points in December despite a 4-point rise from the previous month.\par \par \uc2 "CCI in 2022 improved much better than in 2021 due to the low-base effect," Institute for Demographic and Poverty Studies (IDEAS) economist Askar Muhammad told the Post on Tuesday. BI data show that half of 2021 had the CCI in pessimistic territory.\par \par \uc2 Askar said that the government's success in controlling inflation within a 5-percent range has contributed positively to consumer optimism in 2022, as inflation was expected to soar following a price hike on subsidized fuel last year.\par \par \uc2 For this year, he expects consumer confidence to continue improving, with inflation projected to subside despite many who would remain wary of the effect of global recession.\par \par \uc2 "With a composed consumer confidence, \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth in 2023 could grow optimally, even in the face of a potentially lower trade balance," Askar added.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230111ej1b00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw139\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2085\pichgoal600

LKBN Antara \par \par \uc2 By\par \par \uc2 Jakarta (ANTARA) - Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have an opportunity to dominate the domestic market in 2023 with \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  disrupting global supply chains, Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Minister Teten Masduki has said.\par \par \uc2 "This year becomes a momentum for products of MSMEs or local brands to dominate the domestic market. Because the global supply chains are disrupted, it becomes momentum to make the most of the domestic potential," he saidin a written statement received here on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 n terms of regulations, the government has made a \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  requiring central and regional governments to spend 40 percent of their \b \highlight22\uc2 budget\b0 \highlight\uc2  or up to Rp400 trillion to purchase local products.\par \par \uc2 "It can create an \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  growth of 1.8 percent and create 2 million jobs. This is important amid global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," he said.\par \par \uc2 This year, the key to maintaining Indonesia"s \b \highlight22\uc2 economy\b0 \highlight\uc2  is buying and consuming local or MSME products, he added.\par \par \uc2 "We can see that those who have large purchasing power are the upper middle class whose money is not used during the pandemic. That is because they did not travel and just stayed at home. Now that PPKM (\b \highlight22\uc2 public\b0 \highlight\uc2  activity restrictions) has been revoked, they will start \b \highlight22\uc2 spending\b0 \highlight\uc2  money and support people"s purchasing power," he explained.\par \par \uc2 The deputy general chairperson for entrepreneurship at the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin), Aldi Haryopratomo, also said that this year has become a good opportunity for MSME players to take over the domestic market.\par \par \uc2 He affirmed that Kadin has many programs to help MSMEs gain wider access to markets and industries.\par \par \uc2 In addition, in terms of finance, Kadin is offering many programs in collaboration with P2P (peer-to-peer) lenders and banks to provide financing to MSMEs and is committed to training MSMEs on managing their finances.\par \par \uc2 "We want to strengthen the foundation of MSMEs so they can expand and take opportunities amid the recession," he said.\par \par \uc2 (T.KR-RAP/A/A063/A063) 12-01-2023 23:18:43\par \par \uc2 Document ANTARA0020230112ej1c001up\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 What was missing from Retno's annual press statement\b0\par\par\uc2 1,046 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Kornelius Purba, Jakarta\par \par \uc2 In her annual press statement on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi elaborated in detail Indonesia's major achievements in foreign diplomacy last year and the ministry's priorities for this year.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, she failed to address the issues of the South China Sea, a nuclear North Korean and Taiwan, despite their potential to trigger another world war.\par \par \uc2 The decision to shun the three delicate issues should be made by design. Some senior officials at the ministry hinted that the minister preferred to talk about the matters on separate occasions. Or, probably she wanted President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  to directly address them for greater impact.\par \par \uc2 In her statement, Retno said that global challenges in 2023 would be more difficult than in previous years. "Global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  and dynamic geopolitical situations will continue to characterize the world. Major power rivalries will become more intensified," she said.\par \par \uc2 Quoting the \uc2 IMF\uc2  analysis, she emphasized that the world is facing an imminent global recession, and quoting the \uc2 World Food Program (WFP)\uc2 , at least 50 million people across the world would face starvation.\par \par \uc2 Retno claimed Indonesia produced major achievements in at least five fields:Maintaining the country's sovereignty, protecting Indonesian citizens abroad, enhancing \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  diplomacy, protecting the people from COVID-19 through procurement of abundant vaccines and boosting Indonesia's contribution to peace and security to the region and the world.\par \par \uc2 For 2023, the minister has set four targets as a continuation of last year's success. First, enhancing sovereign diplomacy, including resolving disputes on land and sea boundaries.\par \par \uc2 Second, improving protection of citizens abroad, including migrant workers. Third, advancing \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  cooperation; and fourth, actively promoting peace and humanitarian diplomacy.\par \par \uc2 There should be reasons why Retno was reluctant to talk about the long-standing South China Sea dispute, the increasing nuclear threats from North Korea and the danger of forced reunification of Taiwan by Beijing. But as this year's chairman and de-facto leader of ASEAN, Indonesia should openly and clearly disclose where it stands on the three major security issues.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia should also openly express its and the whole ASEAN's intention to participate in the problem-solving efforts, no matter how the conflicting parties will react to Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Regarding the South China Sea, the resources-rich waters are claimed by China and four ASEAN member states: Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Indonesia is not a claimant, but China insists that it has the fishing rights in Indonesia's exclusive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  zone (EEZ) in the Natuna waters that border the South China Sea.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia must redouble the push for negotiations to agree on the Code of Conduct (CoC) on the South China Sea. It will be non-binding, but at least there is a clear guideline on how to act to reduce open conflicts in the high seas. The United Nations does not recognize China's claim over the most of the maritime territory, meanwhile, the four ASEAN members have problems among themselves.\par \par \uc2 In connection with North Korea's nuclear arsenals, South Korea's President \uc2 Yoon Suk\uc2 -yeol told AP on Tuesday the North's spike in missile tests, growing nuclear ambitions and other provocative acts pose a "serious threat" that could lead to a dangerous miscalculation and spark a wider conflict.\par \par \uc2 President Yoon indicated the South would get ready for casus belli which means an act or situation that can provoke or justify war. The North has become\par \par \uc2 more aggressive in showing off its nuclear weapon development.\par \par \uc2 Kim can do anything he likes without any control mechanism; an accidental mistake or an overconfident view by Kim may trigger an open war in the Korean Peninsula.\par \par \uc2 "We've seen a miscalculation leading to serious wars many times in history," Yoon said, adding that the North's advancing nuclear arsenal poses a direct threat to the United States mainland as well as South Korea and nearby Japan.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to the tension in the Taiwan Strait, Beijing has reportedly stepped up its military-pressure tactic on the island, including by sending fighter jets across the median line of the Taiwan Strait separating the two.\par \par \uc2 Chinese President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  warned in October that he would "strive for peaceful reunification", but then gave a grim warning, saying, "We will never promise to renounce the use of force and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary."\par \par \uc2 The Biden administration has been steadfast in its support for the island as evident in the Taiwan Relations Act, in which the US is required to provide the island with the means to defend itself without committing US troops to that defense.\par \par \uc2 President Jokowi has chosen the theme of Indonesia's ASEAN chairmanship, ASEAN Matters as the Epicentrum of Growth. Under its chairmanship, Indonesia is keen to make "ASEAN important and relevant for the people of ASEAN and beyond".\par \par \uc2 To translate the theme, the Foreign Ministry, for example, has set up a special team, the Office of Special Envoy for Myanmar, comprising top and senior diplomats who directly answer to the minister, to accelerate settlement of the political and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. Former foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda is tipped as the special envoy.\par \par \uc2 President Jokowi's internationally praised success as the host of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  Summit in Bali in November has steadily raised his international standing and earned him a credibility to participate in settlement to major international conflicts.\par \par \uc2 As the chair of ASEAN, the President is determined to reach a meaningful breakthrough in stopping Myanmar's junta from their atrocities against the people following their coup against the democratically elected civilian government of \uc2 Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  in February 2021.\par \par \uc2 Minister Retno has done a very good job as Jokowi's chief diplomat last year, especially in making Indonesia's G20 presidency a success and ensuring ASEAN's unity and consistency in the face of Myanmar's military junta.\par \par \uc2 But to be honest, the absence of South China Sea, North Korea's nuclear threats and the tension brewing in the Taiwan Strait from Retno's foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlook on Wednesday is regrettable.\par \par \uc2 It would be good for the minister to explain the reasons for the missing points in her statement.\par \par \uc2 ___________________\par \par \uc2 A senior editor at The Jakarta Post\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230113ej1d00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Retno highlights RI's increased leadership role\b0\par\par\uc2 A. Muh. Ibnu Aqil, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 780 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia plans to continue contributing to the world by taking a leadership role in the challenging global situation of geopolitical rivalries, both regionally and internationally, while it seeks to be a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in 2029-2030.\par \par \uc2 Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi expressed this aim during her 2023 annual press briefing on Jan. 11, when she outlined Indonesia's foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  achievements in 2022 and priorities for 2023.\par \par \uc2 The minister said the country was committed to always be part of the solution in facing global challenges, which would become more difficult in 2023.\par \par \uc2 "Global \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainties\b0 \highlight\uc2  and geopolitical dynamics will continue [in] the world. Major power rivalries will become more intense," Retno said on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Against that backdrop, she said, Indonesia's 2023 ASEAN chairmanship had adopted the theme "ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth".\par \par \uc2 Retno added that stability and respect for international law, as well as prioritizing inclusive cooperation, were the keys for ASEAN to become the epicenter of regional growth in a peaceful Indo-Pacific.\par \par \uc2 "Therefore, the AOIP will be implemented in the spirit of Indonesia's chairmanship priorities," Retno said, referring to the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\par \par \uc2 She noted that many countries had adopted their own concept of the Indo-Pacific. Synergy was thus required so these various concepts "do not exacerbate rivalry", and the region must be approached from not solely the security aspect but also inclusive \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  development.\par \par \uc2 The minister also said one of Indonesia's diplomatic priorities in 2023 was peace and humanitarian diplomacy. As such, the country intended to apply to become a nonpermanent member of the \uc2 UNSC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Given Indonesia's global role and active contributions, Indonesia has decided to put forward our candidacy as a nonpermanent member of the \uc2 UN Security Council\uc2  for 2029-2030," Retno said.\par \par \uc2 "Indonesia will continue to contribute and play a leadership [role] amid a world full of challenges, leadership in a challenging world."\par \par \uc2 Global tensions\par \par \uc2 Retno's annual press briefing comes after Indonesia completed its 2022 \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  presidency and began its 2023 ASEAN chairmanship.\par \par \uc2 Geopolitical tensions continue to loom in the region against a backdrop of tensions in the South China Sea as well as increased rivalry between China and the United States.\par \par \uc2 In a speech in November at the Global Town Hall 2022 of the Foreign \b \highlight22\uc2 Policy\b0 \highlight\uc2  Community of Indonesia (FPCI), \uc2 US State Department\uc2  Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel J. Kritenbrink said that nations in the Indo-Pacific had witnessed increased threats to their territorial sovereignty, along with "disregard for democratic governance and horrific human rights abuses carried out by totalitarian governments".\par \par \uc2 Kritenbrink said that as an Indo-Pacific nation, the US had a vital interest in realizing a region that was open, interconnected, prosperous, secure and resilient.\par \par \uc2 "The United States will strengthen its own role in the Indo-Pacific again while building the collective capacity of our allies, partners and friends to accomplish our shared goals," he told the FPCI Global Town Hall 2022 by video call.\par \par \uc2 Fu Ying\uc2 , a former Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, Australia and the Philippines, cautioned the town hall that geopolitics as a security challenge and military conflict had returned.\par \par \uc2 Fu noted that the geopolitical conflict in Europe was a result of a "geo-security collision" between Russia and US-led \uc2 NATO\uc2 , while the US was provoking a "strategic competition" with China in the Asia-Pacific.\par \par \uc2 She also wondered whether the world could move beyond conventional geopolitical thinking to develop shared prosperity, or if it would allow geopolitical conflicts to bring an end to globalization.\par \par \uc2 "I have good reason to believe that the majority of countries in Asia want to see the momentum of peace and prosperity continue. They prefer not to be forced to pick sides, much less to allow the original agenda to be shifted from \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  issues to military and security concerns," Fu told the town hall participants.\par \par \uc2 Shafiah Muhibat, deputy executive director for research at the \uc2 Centre for Strategic and International Studies\uc2  (\uc2 CSIS\uc2 ) in Jakarta, noted that Retno's annual briefing did not address major power politics in detail, in particular US-China ties. It also did not directly mention key issues like the territorial dispute in the South China Sea or rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\par \par \uc2 "As an important country in the Southeast Asia region and [with] Indonesia holding the ASEAN chairmanship in 2023, we really expect to see how Indonesia will navigate the [major power rivalry] between the US and China," Shafiah said in a separate discussion on Wednesday about the minister's annual briefing.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230115ej1f00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw298\pich36\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4470\pichgoal540

\par\par \b \uc2 Coal gasification no easy feat, say industry players\b0\par\par\uc2 Divya Karyza, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta \par \uc2 828 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 January 2023\par \uc2 The Jakarta Post\par \uc2 JKPOST\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2023 The Jakarta Post \par \par \uc2 Indonesia's plans for downstream coal industries have a long way to go, and a recently introduced government incentive to accelerate development is deemed insufficient by industry players, particularly those engaged in coal gasification.\par \par \uc2 On Dec. 30, President \uc2 Joko "Jokowi" Widodo\uc2  signed Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Lieu of Law (Perppu) No. 2/2022, which grants companies that hold mining licenses (IUP) or special mining permits (IUPK) the privilege of zero coal royalties if they invest in downstream industries.\par \par \uc2 However, expecting a newly born industry currently dominated by capital-intensive coal gasification activities to thrive solely on the zero-percent coal royalty is "too much", according to Singgih Widagdo, chairman of the Indonesian Mining and Energy Forum (IMEF).\par \par \uc2 Coal gasification accounts for seven of 11 downstream projects, all of which are located in coal-rich South Sumatra and Kalimantan, data from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry show.\par \par \uc2 "The zero-percent royalty incentive is insufficient for contract of work [PKP2B] holders who are working on coal-to-dimethyl ether [DME] projects," he told The Jakarta Post on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The economics of coal-to-DME processing facilities were complicated by numerous external factors, including a limited number of gasification technology owners, which was expected to affect mining firms' capital \b \highlight22\uc2 expenditure\b0 \highlight\uc2 , he explained.\par \par \uc2 "Developing such projects is no easy feat [...] and thus needs the government's [full] support," he said.\par \par \uc2 To accelerate downstream efforts, the government may need to consider granting market access, investment protection and import duty exemption for DME equipment, among other incentives, Singgih suggested.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia, which has the seventh-largest coal \b \highlight22\uc2 reserves\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the world, seeks to transform low-quality coal into value-added products, such as methanol, DME, urea and other compounds.\par \par \uc2 DME would then replace, to some extent, imported liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), Indonesia's cooking fuel of choice, worth around US$4.09 billion in 2021.\par \par \uc2 While coal gasification technology is not new, very few have ever applied the technology because of its poor \b \highlight22\uc2 economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  returns.\par \par \uc2 Coal mining companies have warned that coal gasification was a very expensive undertaking and therefore asked for huge incentives to make projects feasible.\par \par \uc2 For instance, \uc2 PT Bukit Asam\uc2  (PTBA)'s coal-to-DME project may see the state-owned mining firm incur a $377 million loss a year, according to a 2020 report from the Institute for \b \highlight22\uc2 Economic\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Financial Analysis (\uc2 IEEFA\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Publicly listed \uc2 PT Bumi Resources\uc2 ' subsidiaries PT Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) and \uc2 PT Arutmin Indonesia\uc2  also joined the fray with their coal-to-methanol production facilities, which are expected to produce feedstock for domestic chemical industries and biofuels that could help reduce oil imports.\par \par \uc2 "This zero-percent royalty incentive is an encouraging development, and we await details," Bumi corporate secretary \uc2 Dileep Srivastava\uc2  told the Post on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Association of Indonesian Mineral and Coal Energy Suppliers (Aspebindo) chairman Anggawira (one name) sees a financing squeeze as another challenge to developing the downstream coal industry.\par \par \uc2 "Financing schemes for domestic coal downstream industry development are still very limited. Not to mention the fact that the Financial Services Authority [OJK] also prohibits national banks from providing loans for coal mining projects," Anggawira told CNBC Indonesia on Jan. 4.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of global asset managers and large banks have announced their divestment from coal mining or coal-fired power plants, the \uc2 IEEFA\uc2  report found, making it increasingly difficult for coal power and mining firms to raise funds for the industry as pressure grows for firms to get on board with the energy transition.\par \par \uc2 Rizal Kasli, chairman of the Indonesian Mining Experts Association (Perhapi), said on Monday that miners switching from PKP2B to IUPK were subject to the nontax state revenue (PNBP) sales of mines (PHT), which would make downstream coal projects less economically viable.\par \par \uc2 Government \b \highlight22\uc2 Regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  No. 1/2017 requires all coal and mineral mining companies seeking to continue operations in the country to convert their PKP2B permits into IUPK permits, which have a validity of 10 years and come with prerequisites including a levy on PHT and participating in a downstream project.\par \par \uc2 The government has yet to issue more detailed implementing rules for the ministerial \b \highlight22\uc2 regulation\b0 \highlight\uc2  regarding types of downstream coal projects as well as requirements and procedures concerning the royalty exemption, adding \b \highlight22\uc2 uncertainty\b0 \highlight\uc2  to such projects.\par \par \uc2 "The incentive is a positive [start], but it takes more [supportive regulations] to propel the [downstream coal] industry development," Rizal told the Post on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Energy ministry special adviser Irwandy Arif explained on Jan. 4 that, to date, no companies had been granted the incentive, because none had begun commercialization.\par \par \uc2 He said the zero-percent royalty rate only applied to the amount of coal used for miners' downstream projects.\par \par \uc2 "If a company produces a total of 20 million tonnes of coal and uses 6 million tonnes for their downstream project, only the 6 million tonnes would be exempt from the royalty," Irwandy said in an interview broadcast live by CNBC Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Document JKPOST0020230116ej1g00005\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par
